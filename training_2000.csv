1,4,A great read to continue the Bride Train series.  Looking forward to book #4.  This book was hard to put down.,1
2,4,"good western read, with a little sci fi  mixed in. good story and had you hanging right up until the end.",1
3,4,"Sunscreen will not be the only thing found on the beach in Hot Fun in the Summertime by Chicki Brown. Drama! What else could happen when seven people from different walks of life vacation together in a beach house for two hot summer months? The women are the writer, video vixen, real estate agent/accountant, and the hairstylist/cosmetologist. It is through their voices the story is told. What a story it is!Aside from Jovita, who is helplessly in love, the other three women are content in living their life as is. Shontae has buried herself into the world she creates for her characters. Considering she writes romance, she should be the one who believes in love. Due to previous bad relationships she does not give real love a chance. Even with Linda, the one who is the most levelheaded of the bunch, she too has not given love very much thought since her divorce. She keeps herself busy with her real estate and accounting career. As for Linda's younger sister, Kinnik, men are good for one thing...keeping her in fancy designer clothes and paying her bills.While their time on the beach is supposed to be fun and relaxation, this summer will prove to be anything but. Eyes begin to open and things change fast for all the people in the beach house. Whether good or bad, this is a summer they will not forget is one thing they all can agree on.Chicki Brown has done it again. Hot Fun in the Summertime is the second e-book she has released and it is full of romance and drama. Ms. Brown takes great care in describing the setting. By the time I was finished with the book, I longed for the same beach house and the various other places the characters enjoyed. I coin the title and dub Ms. Brown, Queen of e-book romance. Romance readers will love this book.The author provided a copy of the e-book for review purposes.Jennifer CoissiereAPOOO BookClub",1
4,5,"I have to qualify that I am a zombie movie fan, but have never really cared for zombie books. Saying that, if all zombie fiction was written like this, I would definitely jump on the bandwagon. This story was well written, not overly gory, but just gory enough to keep your attention. The relationship between the boy and his father was very real and heartfelt. This author has an excellent grasp of painting relationships between characters with a very 3 dimensional brush. I found that I actually cared a lot what happened to the main characters, and I was irritated when a villainous character crossed them. To me, that is the most important factor in reading fiction. Do I care? Yes, in this case, very much. I am now not only a fan of zombie fiction, I am a big fan of this author. I am currently reading some of his other titles, and will voraciously gobble up any new releases. Keep them coming and I will keep reading!As far as spelling and/or grammatical errors, the story was so engaging to me that if there were any, I was not bothered/did not notice them at all. I was not grading an english term paper, I was reading a very well written compelling book!",1
5,5,"This is a very detailed and unique paranormal story that really sparked my interest.  I found myself reading this one late into the evening, literary having to force myself to stop instead of becoming sieep deprived.  It was that good.",1
6,4,"I really enjoyed this book. Kip and Mandy were meant to be together forever. Despite the ups and downs of life, true love won out.",1
7,5,This is now one of my favorites from Kristen Ashley works! let me tell you that is huge because Kristen Ashley is such an amazing writer that to pick one  even a top five is difficult to do without feling you are cheating on the other stories.That being said Joe & Vi.... HOLY SMOKES!  So incredibly hot and such an incredible story of falling in love all over again after things don't work the first time.,1
8,5,"I like to give short honest reviews. When I read a book/story its for the fun and love of reading.Mile 81 is old school Stephen King, Nightshift, Nightmare & Dreamscape days old school. If you love King shorts you'll love this one.",1
9,4,"Warning: This review might contain what some people consider SPOILERS.Rating: 7/10PROS:- Angel is much less childlike in this story than in the previous one. He's still immature at times, but I thought of him more as a bratty adult sub than an actual child, which was how I viewed him when I read Angel and the Assassin. He shows a level of courage and fortitude toward the end of this book that I would admire in any character; compared to his behavior in the first book, he's very impressive in this one.- There's quite a bit more about Kael's background in this volume, and it's easier to see why he goes so jelly-kneed around Angel when you see instances of similar emotional vulnerability from Kael's past.- We also get a lot more insight into Angel's character by hearing about his childhood. This helped me to understand his juvenile behavior--as well as the core of strength in him--much better.- The relationship depicted in these books is different than those depicted in many other BDSM romances in that the men's relationship is not exclusive sexually. I'm not a particular fan of that facet of the relationship, but I do like that Angel and Kael are both secure enough in their feelings for each other than they can play with other people and not have to deal with overwhelming jealousy afterwards.CONS:- The writing isn't bad, but there's quite a bit of unnecessary telling and repetition. Here's an example: Kael is teaching a class and has asked for a volunteer. No one speaks up except Angel, who performs the task perfectly, and then there's this: ""Every hand went up. Angel had shamed them into doing their job."" It's obvious from the first sentence that the other characters have been shamed into doing their jobs. We don't need to be TOLD that.- The plot outside of the romance is decent enough, but for some reason it just didn't grab me and hold on. I was far more interested in Angel than Kael, so the scenes in which Kael was off on his own, Angel still at home, didn't hold my attention too well.Overall comments: There's a tendency toward melodrama in the characters' actions here, but it didn't seem as extreme to me as it was in the first book. This one's toned down a bit from its predecessor, and I liked it more as a result. I don't think you have to have read the first one in order to enjoy the story here; if you HAVE read the first one, though, be prepared for some small changes in the characters' actions and personalities. Kael is more emotional (which leads to volatility and irrational behavior), and Angel is more mature.",1
10,5,"Up for a challenge, Abie Holloway takes on the assignment to lure tall, sexy Tyler toward accepting a contract to sing for The Centenniel Committee at their annual fundraising event. Abie is next in line at Mitchell's Promotions for a vice presidency if she can pull the proverbial cat out of the hat. Tyler never performs for an intimate audience but cash is needed to keep his ranch operating as the retreat center for troubled teens that it has become. Abie is all business but her attraction for Tyler messes with her head and keeps her off track. Great read and hard to put down.",1
11,4,"Fantastic way to start a book! I mean having Keara's parents die is horrible, but in doing that it gives this book a great platform to take off from.After Keara's parents death, her weird aunt Aingeal moves in with her from Ireland and life as she knows it comes to a complete halt. And I mean complete and utter halt. Home school, in-her-room hermit with no outside contact for 2 months! That is until her gay best friend Jared (I love that he's gay) comes swoopin' in to bust her out of her rut by going to a concert that involves her favorite band EVER. While out that night Keara gets an uneasy feeling that someone is watching her....that's when she spots Channing. Blond hair, piercing eyes that make her melt on the inside, you know the whole teenage heart throb thing. She's not sure what it is about him that makes her senses go wild, but she likes it!After running into Channing again at Night Secrets, a new club in town, she knows she's got the hots for him.  She also notices that she's catching the eye of the mysterious club owner, Corbin. After coming to Keara's rescue she feels as though Corbin would do anything to make sure she's safe....that is until he's suddenly attacking her in the parking lot of his club. Or is he?Now with secrets revealing themselves at every turn Keara must trust those around her to keep her safe, but more importantly she must learn trust what is locked inside herself and believe she can tap into before it's too late.Ok....coming down from this read I was initially SUPER excited about it. I enjoyed the twist that was given on the paranormal side of things, but I wanted to book to be longer. The plot was good, laid out well, I just know it could have used a couple more chapters. Oh and assuming that this novel is YA simply because the main characters are in high school is an epic fail on my part, because man there was a scene, or two,  that had me blushing!One thing that I really liked was, if a decision was made that would contradict what a previous character stated, the author was able to pull the plot & side plots together to make it all run together extremely well. This is hard to do, and I've found myself lately asking authors, ""Why are you letting that happen, it doesn't make sense!"", needless to say the book doesn't give me answers & it's frustrating as hell!All in all, this was a really good read. I'm looking forward to where BK takes Keara on her journey, and hoping the next book is a tad bit longer.4/5",1
12,5,Katie Reus is an excellent writer.  I just love to read her books.  She is a writer that keeps you captive.,1
13,5,The best thing about this series is the fact that it could be neverending :) There are always more stories to tell when it involves surviving the Zombie Apocalypse.,1
14,5,This was such a great follow-up to the book Tempted.  It provided such insight and allowed me closure that I had not realized I lacked in Tempted.  I think the cover art may scare some people off - but believe me this is not gay porn (even though my husband looked at the cover photo on my kindle and was shocked that I was reading what he thought was gay porn).,1
15,5,Its true that it is a short story but it is very sweet too.  Wish that all life problems end up happily like this story.,1
16,4,"Luc Tessier is one of the most successful chef's in the world and he has the arrogance to prove it. The only problem with his charmed existence is food critic Daniel Sheridan who has been maligning his food and ruining his reputation. So Luc invites Daniel to his restaurant to come test his cuisine and hopefully sway the critics opinion on his food. That is until he meets Daniel. The older stuffed shirt he'd imagine bears little resemblance to the sexy man who appears inside his restaurant and his whole focus changes. Now, all Luc can think about is getting Daniel in his bed. But Daniel knows of Luc's playboy reputation, so Luc has to do everything in his power to prove to that he can be committed in all things.I've read Ms. Blackwell's previous release and loved it. So when JUST DESSERTS came up and I saw that not only was it by one of my new favorite authors, and she was writing about food and chef's, I was all over it because whenever I manage to wrestle control over the television from the kidlets, I always turn the television onto the Food Network. So I couldn't wait to read JUST DESSERTS.I don't know if I had unrealistically high expectations because I really enjoyed her previous release, but I was a little disappointed with JUST DESSERTS. It was a little too much for me (in terms of some of the sexual content and whether I thought it fit the charecter development), but I freely admit that it's a personal thing. Despite my personal feelings, I happen to know four of five people at the top of my head who I could recommend JUST DESSERTS to who will love it and think I'm a moron for not giving JUST DESSERTS a higher rating. There are a couple scenes that are actual drool worthy for any m/m fan. The sexual chemistry between Luc and Daniel was off the charts, and my only grip about the whole story was the lack of an emotional connection to equal the great sexual chemistry between them.Review courtesy of CK2S Kwips and Kritiques",1
17,5,Really liked this book from the standpoint of the inner workings of the machines. Didnt really care for the last part of the book but the history more than made up for it.,1
18,5,"Ever since I found out that people voted on which books should be in the Bible, I was fascinated - and determined to read what was voted out. In my quest for unknown wisdom and sayings of Jesus, I soon found the Gospel of Thomas. And it turns out the book attributed to the 'doubter' among Jesus' followers actually contains the most precious wisdom of all. It feels pure. It feels original. It's obvious that parts of the traditional gospel were derived from these sayings. And the author does a very good job of analysing the 114 sayings in this gospel, looking at them from all angles, not shying away from referring to other philosophical masters such as Lao-Tze. Yet, he doesn't want to force his insights upon us - he clearly states at the beginning of the book that we should each seek to interpret scripture our own way. I found this book to be a true gem, even if you already know the Gospel of Thomas and have some ideas about what the ideas contained therein may mean. Let yourself be fanscinated and swept away by mr Kapuscinski's interpretation and analysis of a book as old as the dawn of our Christian era. Read it in one sitting or read one chapter each day and take the time to contemplate it. You won't regret reading this book!",1
19,5,This is a series of stories that should be read in order. Piper creates a universe in which each of these stories form a portion of the common history. This is classic sci-fi so you'll find the technology dated. I found it amusing. It doesn't affect the story though.,1
20,5,As always!!! Loved them!! Love the Westmoreland family. All five of the books were fantastic.  Looking forward to the next five.,1
21,4,What a very touching love story. Lord Bernard falls head over heals for Lady Joanna and rescues her from an abusive hudband. This was a shorter read and has slight feelings of being incomplete....BUT it was enough to hook me. I cant wait to read the other books in this series!,1
22,4,"The Dragon Knight series takes a short turn away from the main characters to tell the story of Lucia and Marcus. Lucia is a commoner who is working as a serving maid at a local tavern. Lucia has been trying to help a dragon (Sir Reynor) who is hurtand ill, but her skills are not up to the job. She finally goes to the castle to get help from a healer and is immediately involvedwith the dragon's knight Sir Marcus and his partner Sir Kaden, Reynor's mate.Lucia is a from the country of Helios, raised by the Jinn, she does not have a commoner background, she has a limited healing ability and is not afraid of dragons. Sir Marcus is totally captivated by her and his partner is also attracted in spite of his feelingsof guilt about Reynor's injury. The three can become a family, if Reynor can be healed and is able to fly again. Learning about Lucia's background and why she doesn't act the part of a serving maid becomes part of her attraction to the two knights.This story was listed as number 4.5 in the series and was only $2.66. I enjoyed this story and liked the character development,not sure if this shouldn't have been a regular book in the series, as it provides an intergral part of the plot. If you're reading the entire series, don't miss this book.",1
23,5,I stayed up way past my bed time to finish it. I enjoyed the book and will be reading mire by this author,1
24,5,"what can I say about this book. it was a sweet story about what can happen on a vacation. the characters had me glued to the book. I was on the edge of my seat wanting to know what happened next. the dialogoue was fantastic, creative and inspiring. this is the 2 nd book I have read by the author and she clearly does not dissapoint.",1
25,4,"I just had to read this book about this couple that actually did what a lot of us dream of doing!  Selling it all and moving to an island in the Bahamas.  What I didn't expect is how hard it is and how much work it took and takes them.  But I was glad to hear about the warmth of the island folk, and enjoyed reading about the day to day life there.  This book is entertaining and educational at the same time.  I do wish there were more pictures, I would love to see more pictures of the beauty of the island.  I know it must be breathtaking.  Thanks for sharing your story with us and I hope you write another book to let us know how the saga continues!",1
26,5,"I saw this book in my local library time and time again when checking out books by Jaci Burton and thought it might not be worth reading.  Was I so ever wrong!! The powers that Aidan had and the need for Melissa was fun to read. After Melissa opened her heart & Aidan too, the powers he held within his body added additional flair to the story. Great book Jaci!!",1
27,5,I gave this book a five star rating.  Loved 're story line made characters real to me. Liked the slow way their loveThere romance form.  Recommend this book to anyone even it was not the usual books I read. Enjoyed the story line.,1
28,5,"This story showed that even when you're really not looking for love it can hit you smack dab in the face and you, can't let it go or you lose yourself.",1
29,5,"Kate's run from Alaska to Hawaii. She's scared and heartbroken and she barely steps foot outside. But as a shaman had predicted, she's got ""bad spirits"" and trouble finds her anyway. This time it's not the drug lord, rather it's some Hawiians bent on returning to the old ways. Old ways that include human sacrifice...As always, Ms. Berkom delivers a well written enjoyable story that's impossible to put down. I just love Kate, she's always doing the unexpected and that's what keeps her alive.",1
30,5,"am wondering if there is some real truth in this story, in real life.There is a lot of political cover ups & the characters are well fleshed out.  I think the story needed another chapter in order to have a better ending. Perhaps there will be a sequel?",1
31,5,This fast paced book kept me thoroughly entranced.  The plot is well woven and has a definite solution and resolution.  This a book I want to read again.,1
32,4,"I'm a HUGE fan of dragon shifters and this was my second time reading this story and I enjoyed it just as much as the first! There's so much to enjoy within; great characters, a ton of emotion, a hot male/dragon, a kick butt heroin and a sweet and touching romance that will curl your toes. Any paranormal romance reader will love the escape they get with Dragon Blues.Lila is a very strong, independent and dangerous woman that knows how to defend herself in any given situation. Actually, she's so well trained her body is a lethal weapon! Having actually killed twice in her life protecting others, she's afraid of what the outcome may be if she's found out, but keeps going forward and living her life. Receiving a call from a stranger that her sister is in need of her, she packs up and runs straight to her only to find an uncomfortable situation that she's trying her best to deal with. This stranger is a very handsome man that was only trying to help her sister and she finds herself very attracted to him, but keeps pushing it away. When she finds out her sister has been murdered only days after first seeing her, she plans to find the murderer and give him what he deserves, a painful death. But will she have to find him and complete her revenge alone or will Noah accompany her and help her find who it is?Noah is a lone male, and is also a dragon, a very fine one at that!

The only other things he's ever loved are his cat and his treasures, that's until he meets the beautiful warrior, Lila. She does strange things to him that are unfamiliar and he finds the pull hard to resist. But he's lost on how to proceed without pushing her away.These two go through so much together and make an amazing team! Be ready for an emotional, sensual and exciting ride :)",1
33,4,"""All That Remains"" is an interesting short story set in a zombie apocalypse.  The zombies and the destruction are only background noise, however, as the tale is an emotional confrontation unravelling in the mind of the main character.  The only zombie to make an appearance is known to this character, which triggers the struggle.For the most part, the writing is good.  There are issues with grammar and pronoun confusion--namely using a pronoun that doesn't have an obvious connection to a subject.  Some odd turns of phrase and misplaced commas also create some confusing sentences.  I wouldn't consider these quirks to be major as they aren't enough to make you stop reading.Two oddities caught my eye: the main character wields a rifle in the story, but she has to cock back a hammer.  Since the type of rifle is never described, it's not a big deal; but most of the modern rifles I've shot don't have a hammer.  The other oddity involved the need to disable the brain stem, but the character pointed them towards the top of the head to do so.  Again, maybe my biology is off but the brain stem is near the base of the skull.  Neither one of these oddities are deal-breakers, however.""All That Remains"" is a great quickie for anyone that enjoys thriller situations with a touch of emotion thrown in.",1
34,5,"When I started reading this book I was so disappointed because it was about Carlotta Ennis.  She was such a selfish person in the first two books of The Brides of Bath series.  She never cared about anyone but herself.  I was so angry with her for not having her son with her I wanted to scratch her eyes out and she always wanted what was out of her reach.  After a few chapters I started changing my opinion of her.  She went from a selfish, self-adoring person to a caring, loving wife and mother.  The many ways she helped her husband changed my mind about her.  I understand now that she was a frightened and lonely person.  Ms. Bolen has a way of changing a character in such subtle ways that it was done before I realized it and I liked the new person she created. I had almost forgotten what kind of vixen Carlotta was before she met James.",1
35,4,"This is a book every mother should give her young teenage daughters to show them what to look for in a man. It's a romance that shows the power of God when hearts are yielded to Him. It's a story of God's grace and healing. Carrie Turansky reminds me of a modern day Grace Livingston Hill, whose love stories enthralled an entire generation. The characters are so real, with hurts and preconceived notions about people ... in other words, just like us. You'll want the story to go on and not end. Novel Journey and I give it a high recommendation. It's a must read.",1
36,5,"This book was the 2nd installment of a journey into the paranormal unknown. It was emotionally deep, humorous, clever & interesting. This series is not like other paranormal series. It's a fresh take on the genre. I love the characters. They feel very real to me. I love that they are so human, although they are not.This adventure is very interesting & addictive. The dialogue is great & gaining insight into the way they think & feel, given their unexpected journey into the unknown, is very complex. I am hooked, fascinated & unable to get enough. Thanks H.T., you've got another great book in this series.Note: try to read these books in the order they were intended.",1
37,4,"This is a good series.  The author uses the &#34;multiple events going on at once&#34; approach, and sometimes I get lost trying to remember who this character is again, or that character, but other than that, he keeps my interest in the story. I bought the whole series, and am looking forward to Book 3.",1
38,5,Why do children die? What is their mission in the afterlife. How do they make choices even with the guidance from relatives who have gone before them. Excellent tale of a young boys heavenly adventure.,1
39,4,A Great read. The Husband to be is a special person who is anyone's dream of a hero to be tied in marriage to.,1
40,4,Enjoyed reading this because it held my interest to the very end.  The characters were all very interesting and had a great plot.,1
41,5,"This short story was definitely worth reading and took me on an emotional roller coaster ride. I caught a glimpse of the early years in a couples' marriage and witnessed its demise, as slowly but surely, their emotional lives together came to a crashing halt. They were together discussing the future in bed, believing their marriage may end in divorce. However, the husband made allusions to the fact that everything would go to his wife, that everything including the kids would soon be hers.At the end of the book I was left wondering whether the bedroom conversation even took place or if it was two souls communicating, a husband trying to convey a message to his wife and, given her response, he decided to no longer fight.I'd really encourage you to read this book, especially if you're struggling in a relationship or about to embark on one.",1
42,4,"Let me start this review by saying: Holy Freaking Monkeys this book was STEAMY SIZZLING HOT! Getting that out of the way I can tell you The Gladiator's Master was a very nice surprise. If I'm honest I wasn't expecting to like this book as much as I did, but this book was great in many ways.Gaidres is a man who lives for revenge. His previous owner Cruxos came to his little town and not only took him as a slave, he also murdered his lover. After Cruxos death, his nephew Caelius has inherited him and the ludus where Gaidres has lived the last couple of years. Caelius may not be the man who took him as a slave but just by sharing Cruxos blood Gaidres considers him guilty, therefore in his revenge plans he needs to die too.After arriving to the ludus and meeting his new gladiators for the first time Caelius is appalled at the conditions they have been living.  His uncle's ""care"" left a lot to be desired. Caelius is a man who doesn't enjoy violence but see the ludus as an opportunity to increase his political power; for that reason he wants to bring the ludus back to his former glory and decides to invest in the gladiators welfare. One gladiator has caught his eye, not only he is the one in the best shape but Gaidres also has a daring look. Caelius names Gaidres as the ludus representative and mediator. But what Caelius really wants is for Gaidres to come willingly to his bed.Gaidres is intrigued by Caelius, not only he is a different kind of dominus but he is also a very attractive man. Gaidres knows Caelius wants him and if he is honest with himself he wants him too. Making his decision, Gaidres come to Caelius' bed. On the beginning he wants to get closer to Caelius just to wait for the perfect opportunity to kill him, but after spending some time with Caelius Gaidres realizes that the Roman he should hate is slowly stealing a place in his heart. A place Caelius will be very please to keep if just Gaidres allows him.I really liked Gaidres, he is the perfect tortured hero who needs to leave his sad and traumatic past behind to be able to embrace his future and all the good things that will come with it.Even though I liked caelius I found his character a bit too modern for the times. I'm not so sure how a Roman society would have accepts his actions without a problem.My final thought: As I said before I really loved The Gladiator's Master. This book was not only sexy but also emotional intense. The characters are strong and well developed, the story line is interesting and entangling and the writing was beautiful. There are many (great) sex scenes but they are all masterfully written. At no time they felt like fillers but more like an important part in the development of the relationship.The Gladiator's Master is a book you will read with a grin on your face and a book I recommend you if you like m/m sexy stories.",1
43,5,"Reincarnation does not make for me sleeping. Loving the book but I am going to have a nightmare for sureDone and loved Colin the best even though the reincarnations ha me scared. After I go to LoDo I wanna go to Laceybourne for sure. The characters were rich and very descriptive. I enjoyed the Beatrice and Royce characters and their history. They were in love and murdered  having their throats slit. The murder happens before they are able to consummate their relationship. This starts a curse that comes back to haunt them when they are reincarnated in the present day.Colin and Sybil are waiting for their soul mates. He's a man of wealth and power, she is an American in England.  Both are losing their faith in love. It took a while but Sibyl warmed up to him.

47,5,"I bought this book back in 2012 and finally got around to reading it this week on my Kindle - and boy, am I glad I did. This is a fascinating world that deserves more books, plus more detail about how the world got that way (though I can see it happening right now, so...). It is rich in detail, yet the detail doesn't drag the story down. My only kvetch is the heroine toward the end, and her flip-flopping on the hero. It makes sense, yet I did tend to skim some of those parts to get to the climax of the book. Overall, for a debut book, this is a terrific one - and I hope there are more in the series. If you haven't read this, do - it'll be a good heads up, about what could very well happen to our own world.",1

49,5,"After reading the ""bad"" reviews, I passed on this one. Then I read Mr. Bebb's disclaimer. I was hooked. Even though it was supposedly hard follow (too many characters too soon) and not worth finishing (too much gore and blah blah blah....), what the Keck, I'll give it a go. Truly glad I did. Enjoyable read. Thanks again Mr. Bebb.",1
50,5,"I will have to say that I typically don't like dragons but this dragon...oh my...I loved him!  Plus, I love a good mystery and this story had it in spades.  What I found interesting was how Ms. Pape incorporated the fantasy element with the mystery that surrounded the dragon.  The dragon had its own personality.  He drinks beer for goodness sake and is well versed in the modern era.  I loved that he starts off as being a bit of rogue but in the end, he's just a big ole' softie.The romance between Eric and Lori was utterly charming and believable.  I instantly connected with them and watching the slowly grow to love each other was a treat.  Yes, they had only met but while it could have been instalove/lust it doesn't.  Lori has the most to lose in the relationship since is coming off a very bad relationship with a co-worker and having to deal with all the stuff that comes with it.  I loved the scenes when is confronted with dealing with the ex and his new love.  LOL!The secondary characters of Ben, David and Wesley were brilliant.  While everyone in the book was a so-called geek, they were completely comfortable in their skins and made no apologies for who and what they were.  Utterly relatable and charming.  I also liked the secondary romance in the book between Ben and Wesley.  Talk about being stubborn but in the end, Ms. Pape did a great job with them and it didn't distract from Eric and Lori's romance.The mystery element was good and intriguing.  It wasn't a hard storyline to follow and what made is so interesting was the dragon's input to the situation.  There were moments were I was laughing out loud with the dialogue between the characters.Again, I don't read a lot of books with dragons but I can not recommend this book highly.  Great characters, a relevant storyline and a great romance make for an awesome book.I miss Drake already.Marika/Harlie",1
51,5,I wish It was a full length story! I wanted to read more. It drew me into the series and Im loving it!,1
52,4,"This second in the Secret McQueen series lives up to the potential of the first.  The environment in which Secret travels in her search for Holden's secret is rich in atmosphere, description and definitely thrills.  The dialogue, especially that between Holden and Secret is at the same time witty double entendre with an undercurrent of deadly repartee and warning.  The characters are supernaturally varied enough to be individuals, and the association of both taste, sight, and smell Secret associates with her werewolf lovers is an interesting facet.  We learn more about her own background in this one, also.Though the plot's much too complicated to give more than a brief synopsis, it's definitely one I recommend, and one you won't want to miss.  The story's exciting, sexy, bloody, and has a definitely surprising ending.This novel was supplied by the publisher and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1
53,5,"Be careful what you wish for . . .Paul wished for a demon slave to bring his every fantasy to fruition (an X-Box 360, Lauryn the hot office temp). Instead, he got stuck with Scarth, quite possibly the most annoying demon that hell ever spawned. He's destructive, he's irritating, and he's a bit . . . thick. He also has a nasty habit of eating people when he can't score some ice cream. What is Paul to do when even hell won't take him back?I absolutely adored this fresh and witty tale and recommend it to urban fantasy fans! With a fast-paced plot and quirky, unforgettable characters, it will leave you wanting more.*goes off to grab the rest of the series*",1

Book 3Seduced by a Cajun Werewolf.Stormy Weather""a 5-in-1 anthology"" - books 1-5 in the one place, at the one price!Plot:Sent by her Stalker to find Angelica in the Bayou, Jules and Andre return her to their ""cabin"" to wait out the hurricane and have Hot Sex. But can they also have a HEA?Comments:- Contemporary paranormal (shape shifting, magic, telepathy) erotic romance with menage sex scenes.- 905 kindle locations, 16,000 words (novella). Finishes around location 840.- m/f/m, m/f - explicit, generous, frequent. No m/m (brothers). Aiming for a committed m/f pair - Brother Andre is just there for the fun sex until the hurricane passes.- Includes an excerpt from ""Seduced by a Cajun Werewolf"".Opinion:This is one of those books where she hops into bed with the two hunky guys and forgets about The Real World. When she comes back down, there's still the crazy Stalker and Magical Werewolves to deal with... But it's a novella so we only touch on *that* stuff. There's sex to be had! A highly erotic story with not a huge amount of storyline and a somewhat rapid ending. But that's fine. It doesn't *need* to be anything else. ""Bitten in the Bayou"" delivers on it's goal - hot menage sex with two werewolves and an Instant HEA. Why not?I will note the paranormal is somewhat incidental - more ""the beast within all men"" than base wolf attributes living in (almost) harmony with the civilized man. It isn't necessary to the plot, and in fact detracts somewhat from the ending.3.5 stars rounded up. The sex is HOT. And I like the character development. Looking forward to Andre's story inMated to a Cajun Werewolf.-CR-",1
57,5,"That was excellent. 4 first books were amazing, I was not sure first about last two. I wish the story would explain what was in Gideon's mother diaries and why she was depressed. Also, Madeline had 4 sisters, no brothers. But Francine still had the same last name. Was she coming from another branch of the family? I hope maybe there will be a 7th book",1

Heroine Lady Emma Easton and hero Viscount Drake must overcome the loss of loved ones, the machinations of Emma's perfidious father and their own personal demons before finding happiness. Using vivid descriptions, Ms. St. John makes you feel you're actually at Westbourne and you'll find yourself smiling, laughing, and crying along with her characters. Her plot twists keep you turning the page and her secondary characters are as superbly developed as Emma and Drake. Like me, you'll be anxiously waiting Malcolm and Katherine's story. Bravo, Ms. St. John.",1
61,5,"The only part I wasn't crazy about was the flashbacks to wartime. Other than that, the author did a tremendous job of keeping me interested. The characters and storyline were equally good, which is rare. If you give this one a shot, you won't regret it. Looking forward to more from this author.",1
62,4,"I enjoyed reading the sample, and I liked the rest of the story even better, as the action and conflict intensified.The story is told in first person from the perspective of Tainie, a teenager with self-esteem issues, who has suddenly become a shapeshifter.The story felt real to me, and as I read it, I experienced it as if I was Tainie.  The plot unfolds at a good pace, and the writing flows well. While reading, I found it easy to suspend my disbelief in shapeshifters and such.The only time when I felt I couldn't believe the story was shortly after Tainie realises she's a shapeshifter. I'd have expected that in this situation, she'd be pressing everyone for information, do a lot of research, find out everything she can about shapeshifting. She doesn't, and even consents only grudgingly to listening to her mother who can explain it. During those scenes, I felt alienated from the story. A few pages later, I was again fully absorbed.",1
63,5,"What an exciting book to read! Cowboys & girls will not want to miss this one. A modern day rodeo setting that includes political activists, a mother/son/mom's boyfriend war, and well-written romance, makes this book much more than just another western story. Loved reading this contemporary rodeo adventure by Robert Hatting.",1

66,4,I liked this book because it showed me how many ideas are available if one doesn't get locked up in one category.,1
67,4,"It is short but sweet. Read it in one seating, a 40-minute seating.I'm thinking I'll be reading the other books in the series.",1
68,4,Love in Bloom is great reading.  It is a perfect adult reading - just the right about of romance mixed with sex.,1
69,5,"Let me give you the background on how I came across this book. About this time last year Amazon was suggesting this series to me. I have been reading romance novels for about a year now (I took a hiatus on reading them), and was looking for something new to read. I told myself what the heck the story plot sounded interesting to me.At the opening of the book you meet Robert Beckford, the Earl of Masten at his sister's ball. He catches a glimpse of a beautiful woman. Little does he know that it is his wife, Lydia. Five years earlier Robert marries the girl to save the reputation of his family. After the vows were said and done he dumps her off at one of his country estates never to think of her again. A little older now, Lydia decides that she is tired of being cooped up in her gilded prison. So, Lydia makes her way to London to enjoy a season, no longer caring what her husband thinks. Robert has an urge to get the situation under control again and get his wife back to her place back in the country. He comes up with a plan that no man of his standing could fault him.What you will find in this book will be a scoundrel of a brother, a bastard of a brother, a vindictive ex-mistress, and an unfortunate past that makes this book a worth while read.ALL my really good friends know that I LOVE this series. After reading the first book I told each of them (the ones who love a good romance) to get this book. So, you really should check this book out and I'm sure you will love it.",1
70,4,Another great additiion to the series.  What else can I say?  you definitely need to read these in order or you will be lost.,1
71,4,"It really was suspenseful, unique and well-written. There were some editing lapses, and it was a bit far-fetched, but I was pleasantly surprised to find a 99-cent book that is good enough to be made into a movie.",1
72,5,"When I picked up this ebook, I had no idea what I was getting; romantic suspense, murder mystery, thriller. Much to my delight, I got all three! Amanda Stevens snagged my attention in the first three paragraphs. Her gift of storytelling caught me and held me until the very end. She has the amazing ability to create characters and build suspense in way that is neither boring nor overly verbose. As an introduction to her series, this is off-the-charts terrific. I'm looking forward to reading the rest in the series and feasting on her delicious tales. If you have the opportunity to read her stories, take it! There's plenty of ""junk"" in the ebook world, but Amanda Stevens rises well above and delivers a sharp, powerful story!",1
73,4,"And I mean that for the author and his readers. This was an epic undertaking for me. My first experience reading Akley was his &#8220;Crossroads from Damascus&#8221; novel, so I&#8217;d already experienced his tendency to jump around in time and perspective, so was prepared for it this time. But despite that, it took some time for me to get into the rhythm of the novel. As other reviewers have noted, this is very much a southern gothic novel with not so obtuse references to Sophocles&#8217; Oedipus AND Faulkner. And about one-third of the way into the story, I stopped to read through the timeline at the end and that helped me significantly through the remainder of the novel.The words themselves are well-crafted and Akley has a knack for language that many would-be writers could only dream of. Everything from, &#8220;Sincerity is hard to recover once you&#8217;ve lost it. That&#8217;s why some intentions are best left guessed at. For how else do we recognize each other?&#8221; to &#8220;I learned the earth is not as silent as the sea. And it does give something back as you listen.&#8221;This is no simple novel of the life and times of generations of a family. This is a novel filled with tragedies, successes and small life lessons along the way. While it&#8217;s not a family that I would ever want to be a member of, the stories that unfold are what life is all about in all its glory and heartbreak laid bare for all to see, as uncomfortable as it may be.&#8220;Now that I&#8217;m an old woman I don&#8217;t believe much in choice. They say people can change, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the whole truth of it. Seems like it&#8217;s the circumstances that give people the chance to be different, different from what they were in the past. Just depends on whether the circumstances are better or not as to where they give the credit, or the blame. I guess that&#8217;s why I never saw the point in plans, especially if they tried to involve me. Seemed like it was just a way to give folks a sense of purpose so they felt like they were in control of something, if anything in control of themselves&#8230;&#8221;",1
74,4,"This is slacker noir told by Buddy, a full-time barfly whose policy is to turn any buck without doing it nine-to-five. As Beavis is joined to Butthead, Buddy is joined to the ""big, ugly"" Sal, a bottom-feeding amateur PI with a crumbling 1976 Buick Century. You know right away the pleasure of this book is Buddy's voice and hanging out with these two and it always stays close to the funny. It's never boring and often it's more bloody than funny but still funny. So there's a lot of funny and a lot of action and a really bad smell from the trunk of the Buick. All this is done with a smart comic edginess and an uncluttered style that flows like a late night movie.",1
75,4,"Ok, SO... some of the characters vocabulary was very old fashioned. I used my dictionary quite often. The story was sweet though. There was a lot of mistakes. But I will probably read more from this author.",1

88,5,"Keeping Pace is a sublime tale of love between a young man of twenty-six, who invites the attentions of his dream woman next door, a lonely widow of forty-one by giving her a show to remember.Gorgeous, descriptive, beautifully written, yet so achingly tender and poignant with a divine first encounter over a back fence that left me breathless. Wonderful characters portrayed in such vivid detail, that I couldn't have put this book down to save my life! So full of love and alive were they that I felt like I was watching a movie, not merely reading a work of fiction. Most memorable for me was how I couldn't help but think that Regina and Josh so deserved every happiness together. Yet the thought occurred to me too,(and it made me grin) that perhaps it was Gina that needed to ""grow-up"" not Josh, who so blatantly loved her and was proud to be with her, regardless of what anyone else thought.This is a plot that could have been a stale, repetitive litany with the stench of societies prejudice against an older woman and a younger man having a sexual relationship. Never mind the cruelty, petty jealousies and judgements of others, or even their own feelings of inadequacy, self-doubt, rejection, etc. But instead it came across as fresh, bittersweet, intensely erotic, evocative and had me crying and laughing all at the same time. Simply Bliss!I loved the way Ms. Carney drew upon her secondary characters: Regina's slightly slimy boss Lou, the infallible and endearing secretary, Linda and even Regina's rival, Beth. Each contributing in their own way to the inevitable conclusion and finale. The last chapter was an interesting dichotomy, in that it was the perfect beginning and end to this wonderful love story. I recommend Keeping Pace whole-heartedly and look forward to further examples of Ms. Carney's work.Originally posted at Whipped Cream Reviews",1
89,4,"I was given 'Payback (Channeling Morpheus/Sweet Oblivion #1)' by the author through the Goodreads M/M Romance Group&#8217;s 'Don&#8217;t Buy My Love' program for an honest review. This story is told in first person through the eyes of Michael a vampire hunter.Michael has been setting himself up as bait in order to attract and kill vampires ever since his friend Scary Mary was killed by three of them.The story starts in the middle of the action with Michael waiting for a killer vampire he has a date with. In the meantime he meets a very attractive man named &#8220;Wild Bill&#8221; that insists on hanging around Michael. The story progresses through when Michael is picked up by &#8220;Gray&#8221; the vampire he&#8217;s after, and through a night of sex. The book is mostly a sex scene, but I&#8217;m not complaining.The author did a good job with the character&#8217;s voices; I especially want to know more about Wild Bill, he was quite a character. I wish we knew more about the characters, because we hardly found out anything about them in this story because it was so darn short. It&#8217;s a good thing this is only the first in a series because one short book is not enough of a look into this world.I don't want to forget to mention how much I love the cover. All the covers in this series are terrific. They aren't the same models used on so many other stories covers and the coloring and poses carry an intense energy and grittiness.I enjoyed the level of tension and suspense and the overall feeling of doom. I&#8217;d read this again and would read the other stories in the series. The one flaw, is this story is way too short so I can only give this 4 Stars because of the lack of length.",1

His short stories can carry you off from one place to another quickly.His short stories don't need elaboration to be interesting, exciting or satisfing to read. I've enjoyed each one. I like where he takes you, the first page of the book immediately brings you into into the world of the characters. He's a master story teller who earns and deserves every literary award you can give.",1

It was amazing (Line of Scrimmage) and I sort of put Marie Force on the back-burner. Then I realized she had MORE BOOKS put on Amazon recently! I'm so happy for self-publishing. I want more books!I cried in this book (I am not a crier!). It was fantastic. I was reading some of the other reviews and while some people had problems with the men ignoring their friend, I could see it. People do dumb things and this book worked for me. As in all of Marie Force's books, the relationships and character development were spot on. I am so excited to find another book just added to Amazon, 'The Wreck' and I'm off to om nom nom it down.",1

109,4,"Collective Memory by Tielle St. ClareTalent really showed through in this story.  The book was a bit short, only 12 chapters so there wasn't much room for a full development of the story and characters.This story is about an alien (Cayl) who comes from a planet that has no physical bodies.  They share a Collective Memory. Tangent comment...The Borg/Star Trek...you will be assimilated...This story is all about the funnies, not for the Trekies out there.Cayl was sent to Earth to find a bad guy.  He is assigned a (gorgeous) body and partnered with (beautifully/full figured) Devin who is his agent at the IPC.  At Cayl's intake meeting comes the first quote that's going to comeback to bite Cayl in the butt...Devin says ""And we need to discuss sex"" Cayl replies ""I understand the human reproductive system, Agent Denning; I'm here to capture a killer, not indulge in these intrusive human senses.""  And the hits just keep on keeping on.  You see, the bad guy was last spotted at a sex club called SWITCH.Cayl and Devin need a way to get into this members only club. Enter stage right is Mace (another hunk), a friend of a friend who previously asked Devin out and whom she though was joking and turned down -face palm-  Anyway Devin calls Mace and he arranges to get all of them into the club.  She tries to keep the alien aspect on the down low in the introduction stage but Cayl being Cayl is not shy about his origins.  Mace thinks Cayl is wacky but goes along because...Hello!..Cayl is gorgeous and Mace wants some of that!What happens for the next couple of days between the three of them is Erotic Hot and wicked funny lines.  The mind might be the most sexual organ but Mr. Intellect might change his mind when he explores all his physical senses with Devin and Mace.",1
110,4,"Bonnie Dee writes some impressive historical romances, if for no other reason than they are unique. She takes the same old storylines and gives them a twist which makes them distinctive and definitely interesting!Captive Bride is another mail-order-bride-disaster story, but this time we have Chua Huiann who has come to America to marry Xie Fuhua, a successful Chinese businessman. Her parents hadn&#8217;t met the man, but through Lui Dai, one of Xie&#8217;s servants/agents, they were assured that their beloved, albeit unruly daughter, would have a life of prosperity and happiness. However, when Chua Huiann arrives in San Francisco she finds that things were not at all as they had been made out to be, and her life would be anything but happy.Alan Sommers is the owner of a successful general store. He&#8217;s an honorable, hard working man who is running from the memories and nightmares that haunt him. Having fought in the Civil War and been taken prisoner early on, he spent years in captivity, not knowing whether he&#8217;d live or die, before he was finally released. Alan headed west to start a new life, but his nightmares followed him.This story delves into the racism so prevalent during the time period, and the hardships Asian immigrants endured while trying to make a life for themselves. I don&#8217;t want to go into detail about how Huiann and Alan meet and spoil it for you, but I enjoyed watching their relationship grow into a sweet love story. Their cultural difference and the language barrier made for some fun and touching moments.Overall, Captive Bride was another enjoyable, sweet and sexy read by Bonnie Dee, and I&#8217;m looking forward to more by this talented author.This story was provided to me by netgalley.com in exchange for an honest review.",1

112,5,"According to Twain, Heaven is years from earth, even when you are transported at .1 speed of light. It is huge, containing souls from multiple worlds, creatures only imagined by later SciFy authors. Multiple gates, minimal entry conditions. There is a caste system, and receptions for those who never received reward during life.I wish that wings were more than decoration, but according to Sandy, an elderly resident, you travel by WISHING yourself around to greet new arrivals, or return to earth with divine messages. Most inhabitants only dress up for formal occasions- halo, harp and wings being a sort of uniform.Sandy tells Stormfield: Heaven is a libertarian place- plenty of room, do as you please, appear any age- but it is not paradise as imagined on earth. Idleness does get old, and please do not irritate the patriarchs. Sandy is a keen observer of people in Heaven.The rest of the tale is similarly imaginative. Twain enlivens things by speaking in the argot of a 19th century sailing master, sprinkling dialogue with phrases like:' An ordinary comet don't make more than about 200,000 miles a minute.  Of course when I came across one of that sort--like Encke's and Halley's comets, for instance--it warn't anything but just a flash and a vanish, you see.  You couldn't rightly call it a race.  It was as if the comet was a gravel-train and I was a telegraph despatch.  But after I got outside of our astronomical system, I used to flush a comet occasionally that was something like.  We haven't got any such comets--ours don't begin.  One night I was swinging along at a good round gait, everything taut and trim, and the wind in my favor--I judged I was going about a million miles a minute--it might have been more, it couldn't have been less--when I flushed a most uncommonly big one about three points off my starboard bow. 'Now, this was published 1907, and an early manuscript exists from 1868!",1
113,4,"Pretty good book, an interesting concept on the power module. I like the &#34;whodunit&#34; aspect of it as well. The resolution of the story had a little of a deus ex machina feel to it, it happened really quickly but still a good read.",1

115,5,"An original slant on demon/vampire/fae/magic stories.  Seemingly thereare two sides in this story: the dragons and the seven.  The dragonsare sort of good and the seven are sort of bad.  The hero is theagent of the dragons (sort of a surprise to him) and has as sucha shield, a weapon, and an advisor (the advisor is a ``valkyrie''guardian angel).  In this story the hero gets his act togetherand manages to keep the seven imprisoned, though they have woken up.The action was fast and there were interesting supporting characters.I was sorry the book ended and will buy the sequel: certainly ratesfive stars.",1
116,4,"So here's Elise sitting in a bar, which she never does, having a few drinks alone, which she never does, all because her boyfriend text messaged her that he was calling off their relationship to go back to his wife, which she never knew he had in the first place. So many new experiences all in one day. The bartender asks if she wants another drink and Elise decides shes had enough. She needs to get home it's been a long day, but this big good looking guy with tattoos on his arms and piercings here and there sits down next to her and announces that she should have another drink anyway. She starts to decline and he insists convincing her to tell him why she has had such a long day. She can't understand it but she finds herself pretty attracted to him. He is absolutely NOT her type. She goes for guys in business suits. But after today she's thinking maybe she should try following a different track, besides he was definitely affecting her libido. No this wasn't happening . She'd just been dumped and was feeling vulnerable, but this guy was so gorgeous and hot So she told him what happened to her and he said ""Text message? You serious? Dumbass man."" That kind of wins her over to his way of thinking. Moving on quickly after a lot of talk and flirting the tattooed man says ""Let me take care of you."" Holy cow! She's not even his type. She knows that. He's definitely not hers. WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY THAT! Ha! Ha! Gotta read the book to find out.Hot! Hot! Hot! read. Steamy, Flame blowing, Sweet and touching. Adults only.",1
117,4,"I found Williams book to hold a very special magical value. She has created a new world based off our own, which the reader can connect to, and added in a few humorous similes and metaphors to make the reader smile. I found myself laughing when the leading female character, Michelle, was transported to a magical world. her car crashed into a tree and the author gave a rather fun description of the car from the leading males, Healden, perspective, ""Dirt flew up and concealed its paws, the yellow eyes never blinked even when clumps of earth hit them."" (Chapter 2)As I read further into the book I found myself willed to keep reading by Michelle's misadventures, the villains attempts at seduction, and the dialogue that helped portray each character as individuals.Williams did a wonderful job at creating a book that gives us woman vs herself, woman vs man, man vs man, and added in some wonderful displays of magic that creatively followed the leading characters through out the book.The author has great follow through in her plot and her characters are well rounded with quirks, some witty dialogue, and romance intertwined. I think my favorite part of this book is that Williams captured a leading female character that I could easily connect to who portrayed bravery, love, and confusion making her well round and jump off the pages.The author also had multiple points of view, while I am not particularly fond of more then two separate points of view, I do think Williams pulls it off well.The first few chapters are slow going, but after that the tension builds up and the pages need to be flipped.",1
118,5,"The fascinating characters from the first book in this series are supporting players in the second time-travel romance in the series.  I enjoyed Tami Dee's sense of fun, adventure and romance that came through the pages loud and clear.  Great story!",1
119,5,"Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world during World War II, Gabriela Reyes walks into the Red Rooster. And therein begins a riveting tale of occupied France.This book takes the reader into a world turned upside down, where hard choices must be made in order to survive. Gabriela is smart, nave, brave, and frightened--and always believable and sympathetic. She's highly conflicted about the path she chooses, and the fact that she makes mistakes along that path is what grounds her story in reality. There are simply no easy answers in her world, at that time, but there are plenty of situations in which the reader wonders: what would I do in her place?She finds an unlikely ally in a German as conflicted as she is, whose choices are nearly disastrous for both of them. Threatening them both is the Nazi who brings evil to excruciatingly believable life.The settings--Paris, Berlin, Marseilles, and the unforgettable factory in Strasbourg--are so well textured and layered that the reader feels very much on the scene. Poignantly, scarily so.An excellent read.",1
120,4,"I liked this very much, held my interest from begining to end. I wish it was part of a series.",1
121,4,My 10 year old loves spooky  stories but this one wasn't that great.But it kept her mouth shut through the whole story so I hope  y'all make more.,1
122,5,"I'm new to erotic romance, and I have to say I'm hooked.If you like a hero who's alpha with a big heart, this is the book for you.  You know right off the bat how he feels for his Jule's, and you are rooting for him to get his girl. Ross wants to take his friendship with Julia to the next level, and you so want him to succeed, he's just got to show her just how good it could be between them. He's gentle, but rough and loving, but honest and to the point.I like my heroines who are independent regarding their career, but not so saavy about their personal life and don't know how to get what they truly desire.Sometimes the heroines come off as total *itches in these romance books, and your left to wonder, what the heck did the hero see in her in the first place, This is not so with Julia (though I did want to slap her upside the head at one point.), you know the deep affection these to have for each other, and the fear of losing that connection if they take a huge step over the line of friendship to romance.Love this book and also enjoy the fact that Julia is not a svelte supermodel, but a real woman who's got natural curve, we need more books like this.",1
123,4,"A secret combined with political power equals a man held in an asylum with no reason to be there.

It was a little cliche how all the brothers met up in the end, but who doesn't like a happy ending!?",1
124,5,I absolutely loved this book! Rose is an amazing author who can craft a story that lures you into it. I definitely plan to read more of her books and soon! Can't wait to visit Mystic Hollows again.,1
125,4,"I've got to say this book grabbed me right at the start. Pretty female EMS, yep made me think of myself lol no I am not bragging but I was very pretty and spent 8 years in the US Army as a combat medic driving an ambulance so I sorta had a connection right away with Emily.Emily is a strong independent woman who stands her ground against a partner who is out of control. Though it gets her the raw end of the deal for doing the right thing she bounces right back, heading home and getting a new job doing what she loves thanks to an old time friend. I applaud her for doing what was right even with the outcome in the end. And like I said the outcome was in her favor anyway. Fate always has a way of working things out in the end. And come on ""PETE"" hello yeah I would move to Green Bayou for that too. He made my heart flutter and my knees wobble.Some of the calls that Emily and her partner Jacob would get called on were pretty bad but I don't think any were near as bad as the one they get called out for on Halloween. That one would leave me with nightmares for sure. Phew let's just say Emily handles herself rather well but man what a mess that was. Kudos girl.And Jacob her partner and this ""thing"" between them, *phew* that man is steamy hot, I mean down right southern Louisiana hotness right there and sweet. Mmmmm could eat that right up like jambalaya and po-boys - lol. Unlike Emily I couldn't have said no I would have been ""Yes, Yes, Yes."" Just another reason I loved Emily thought her very strong character and morals even when her body was so telling her ""you know you want to do this."" She did not listen and did what was right. But man you know she was thinking about it.....And Pete, oh make my heart flip flop, my knees wobble and the butterflies go crazy in your stomach Pete. A man in uniform well you can't get any hotter or better than that and sweet. And his proposal to Emily had me tearing right up. So sweet and wow I didn't see it coming but so glad it did.Then there is Kent, what he did during the Christmas dinner had my gears spinning and then again at New Year's Eve. I am just feeling it in my gut there is something not right with him. There is something there, something more than everyone else sees. He's a bad one, real bad, I could feel it in my bones and it wasn't going to be good.""Green Bean - String Bean - Red Bean"" - **Roaring in Laughter** OMG my sides hurt so much after reading that part (get the book to find out and you will be laughing too). LOLThis book had me laughing one minute and tearing up the next. From Alphonse and his goofy self, to the banter between Emily and Jacob, to the friendships between Emily and Pete and Connie and Bert. To the twisted minds of Bart and Kent and the funny and sweet relationship of Emily's parents oh man I loved them. From the EMS call outs to a funny dispatcher, the bimbo store clerk, sleazy sheriff to the horrible events and the amazing outcomes. Laughter & tears, loss and gain. This book rocked and I cannot wait to read the next book in the Green Bayou Series.",1
126,4,"These books are always interesting.  The countryside is vividly described and the people are all of great interest, either good or bad.  They are safe for a youngster to read.  You always want to turn the page to see what happens next, so it is difficult to put the book down..",1
127,4,"Author Jerry W. McKinney is fast becoming one of my favorite voices in horror. So many other reviewers have discussed the great story here, I'd like to focus on what I think is one of the most interesting titles that I've seen. Lycanthropy is the professed ability or power of a human being to transform into a wolf, or to gain wolf-like characteristics. Now that you are armed with that knowledge, you can take at his short story, Lie Canthropy, and see the prominent use of the word ""lie"" as part of the twist on this one. Well done!",1
128,5,"What is love?  In H.R.'S it is usually a cat and mouse game played by aristocrats.  Here it is not different except it feels very different.  The characters feel like real people not like the fairytale characters we have come to be familiar with in HR's.  That Ms Samuels can evoke from the reader such a strong sense of timelessness and place shows she is an author of unique talent and ability. Her descriptions of violent rain does make us shudder with chills.  We can see the glowing colors of the flower gardens in the early morning mist.  This book immerses us in the story.This novel is a romantic tour de force, complete with tortured hero in desperate need of redemption and the just-right heroine risking her all to redeem him.I highly recommend this book, it is exceptional.",1
129,5,"I usually go for books with a more romantic setting, not so cookie cutter romantic but gentler. This book was very good, it had some rough points but it only added to the depth of the story. Keisha had made some less than perfect choices when it came to her relationships and her very strong need to find love  and be loved. Many can say they've had someone in their past who has run in and out of their life leaving behind a trail of heartbreak. She was no different, she also had a child whose father was mentally incapable of taking care of both of them. They loved each but sadly it wasn't meant to be. They say when  you stop looking for something that's usually when you find it. In steps love, wrapped in a wonderfully sexy package. I loved everything about this last character. He was manly yet tender. Regardless of what others felt about him, he knew who he was and he knew what he wanted. &#34;The baby&#34; was never ever an issue and that made him even more sexy. After a few mishaps here and there, the road seemed like smooth sailings and Keisha had finally found what she was looking for. I don't see why it couldn't have been left at that with maybe stories on his sisters and her sister and Missy. I will read the next book  even though the excerpt shows she took my boo and is maybe doing him wrong. Hopefully Cliffy can have his happy ending.",1
130,5,Reminds me of the Lensman series.  Great thought and well well written...Great characters.  I w an t more...thank you for this series,1
131,4,This is a wonderful story of relationships and everlasting friendships. The writer spins the story in such a way you feel you get to know the characters and understand how they look at their vacations as reunions of best friends. Sometimes friends end up being closer and more important than family,1
132,4,"Since other reviews have included a plot and character synopsis, I'll just comment.  While not a depth book, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It was an entertaining distraction while recovering from a pulled wisdom tooth.  Yes, (as one other reviewer commented) there were a few typos that could have used another line edit, but they were not terribly distracting.  The story line was intriguing, though parts were a bit overdone, like the giant man eating spider.  Love scenes were juicy fantasies, but after all, this is fiction.  The author created a number of teasing links to current concepts about Atlantis that I enjoyed and found congruent with my own research.  I don't know where this book comes in the author's writing career, but I hope she keeps writing.  As a fellow writer I know that we keep improving the more we write.  (See my books on Amazon in the product links below.) I look forward to reading more of her work.Star Kids Mission (Star People Series) (Volume 3)The General (Book II: The Star People Series)Sky Warriors (The Star People Series) (Volume 1)",1

134,4,"Taming the Vampire:Summary: Liz Marlowe and Jack Morgan hate each other.  The reader knows this because it is said numerous times and it would be annoying except at the perfect moment it becomes something of a joke.  So hero and heroine do not get along and as fate would have it, they discover a way to kill a shared enemy if they work together.  This one ritual brings them together.  It is a sweet story.  It is a quick read novella that sucked me in quickly.  The only thing I disliked was that when Jack is in denial he refers to Liz as the b-word at least twice.  To be fair to Jack, I wanted to punch Liz when she was on a roll and being mean, but use a better word than the b-word to express that.As soon as I finished this, I was online looking at the next two to buy.  I must admit, I am somewhat of a sucker for the sparks between two people who presumably ""hate"" each other.",1

137,5,"For the love of Anna has made me love the way Lawless tells a story, and led me to read two more of his books (Finding Penelope and The Avenue), and I won't be stopping here. When I read Lawless I feel like the time when I was in college and a single Grisham novel was never enough, and you had to get your hands on another just as you were finished with one. Of course, I'm not comparing the authors, but only stating that Lawless is one master of a storyteller!In For the Love of Anna, Lawless incorporates into a simple boy meets girls plot, a deeper aspect of our world's gentry that is mixed in white collar offense. A look into what power does to people, and what people can do to get that power. How a single turn of events can create a chain reaction of enormous proportions and lead even the simplest of people to do the unthinkable.What happens when the very people who are chosen by us to uphold the law, break it and cause insufferable pain? And what happens when those very people try to bend the law that they make themselves only so they can get away with the punishment that comes with committing the crime. And would you really blame the people whose lives are singularly affected by the crime, when they take the law into their own hands after such injustice is done. Ask yourself all these questions while reading this book and all the grey shades of our law system and the law holders start to become apparent.",1

141,5,"Is this another Stephen King? This book absolutely had me in another world and the thought to return to my real world was not allowed in.. Until I turned the last page. The ending? Not what I expected and I loved it!!! I was so absorbed in this novel and I felt like I was right there with the character trying to make sense of this world he had woken up in. I loved Rudy.. so kind and a almost scary-cat but always faithful.  James wakes up in a strange land and it is in between the real world and something so horrific and yet he finds a way to exist and search for his way home. The amazing creatures scar you and tug at your heart too. This was one book that kept me up way past my bedtime and was simply worth it. This book was a mix between Twilight zone, the outer limits and Stephen King&#8217;s books and&#8230;Spielberg  needs to read this book and bring it to life on screen!!!This book was bought through Amazon",1

151,5,"The second installment of the Celestra series has me eager to continue into the third. One of the things I like most so far about these books is how they keep flowing and progressing in a way that makes me feel like it's a television season. Thus far the books lack an episodic tone but feels more like minor story-arcs that continuously lace the overall premise together.The characters are consistent but evolving at a respectable pace that reflects not only the small amount of time elapsing throughout each novel (seemingly month by month) but their maturity level. Sixteen year olds most certainly possess a learning curve; however, coping with supernatural trauma, functioning in daily life and dealing with romantic interests does become a juggling act.That's why I'm rarely surprised when Skyla drops a ball here or there. Her circumstances are complicated on good days and dire on bad. That's why I find her attitude problems and indecision almost tragically realistic. Her black humor and sardonic reactions keep even the darkest parts of the story entertaining, which is no small accomplishment in a book that could easily grow disturbing or depressing if it took itself more seriously.Tremble is engrossing for its humor, gradually expanding mythos and knowledge of when to up the ante on both the reader and characters. It's establishing a great pace and pitch for the rest of the series and I feel it could become an addictive read for those who like curmudgeon protagonists with comedic reactions to their own peril.",1
152,5,"Life is a series of serendipitous moments, which sometimes result in tragedy and others in finding happiness and love. Aedin creates two mature, multi-dimensional and sympathetic characters, who are both shaped and - to the degree that they can - shape those moments. Over time and distance, and despite the demands placed on them by their jobs and, more in Stuart's case, the effort to move on from loss, their relationship slowly unfolds from instant attraction to commitment, sometimes naturally, sometimes by lucky coincidence, and sometimes through one or the other giving it a slight push and moving out of their comfort zone.Stuart is a pragmatic and humorous narrator, who doesn't like to wallow (and neither his therapist nor his butch dyke best friend, Mariluz, allow him to, when he does). Dustin is a 48-year old pilot, who participates in gay rallies but who's afraid of his mother, and who sends smiley faces in IMs. The two together are funny and hot and sensual and supportive and just about the most interesting couple I've come across in a long time.A definite keeper and re-read!",1

155,4,"At Last - I must say I really enjoyed this story.  I didn't realize when I downloaded the book, that it was a novella.  While reading, I noticed I was at 46%, what?  Can't be, I thought.  My fault.  I didn't read the ""Product Details"" that Amazon provides.My major complaint and disappointment:  It was way too short, and it ended!  I would have enjoyed reading more.  I wish the author had worked this storyline into a novel, not a series, but a `stand alone' novel.",1

157,5,"I downloaded ""Devil's Lair"" for free onto my Kindle with the thought that I would read a bit just to see if it lived up to it's ratings.  Imagine my surprise when I was -- literally -- hooked by the first sentence!  William of Ockham walking barefoot through carnage?  What?  That was enough to keep me reading almost through to the end in one day, and to have me pick it up again the next day in order to finish it as soon as I could.I love the fantasy genre, especially historical fantasy.  I have to say:  I really, really liked this book.  I ""4.5 star"" liked this book, but since that isn't a rating option, and after an overly long inner debate, I finally decided to round up to 5 stars instead of down to 4.  This decision was due to the overall writing displayed by David Wisehart.  I found his prose to flow smoothly with vivid descriptions and engrossing dialogue.  The novel's parallel to Dante's Inferno (DW's knowledge of this literary work shines through), it's historical accuracy (likewise, DW's obvious love and knowledge of the Middle Ages enhances the story greatly), and the introduction and subsequent development of main characters that are likable and to whom one can easily relate, in my opinion, made this book a winner.William is a friar, Giovanni a poet, Nadje a visionary, and Marco is a Knight Templar who all come together in order to travel through the layers of hell (a la Dante's Inferno) in order to find the Holy Grail and save mankind. But there is much more to this story, as we are introduced in detail to the characters and see their noble assets as well as their fatal flaws.  No one is allowed to escape their humanity or their fears in the face of needing to do the right thing.  I thought that the brief encounters with the famous and unknown alike throughout their journey to and through hell held insightful clues and lessons, and that the trials and triumphs of these four spoke to what can be accomplished with a unified good v evil front.There have been some flaws of ""Devil's Lair"" mentioned in other reviews with which I agree: the untranslated Latin phrases were a bit of a stumbling block, there were a couple of modern-sounding phrases that didn't seem to fit into the story's time frame well, and there was one particularly brutal scene that seemed to come out of nowhere and then disappear just as quickly.  To me, in light of the generally above-average editing, these things did not take away from my enjoyment of the story.I highly recommend ""Devil's Lair"" to others.",1
158,4,"Cat Ryan, the main character in ""Like Casablanca,"" is on the cusp of forty. So, it's not clear whether this book is Chick-Lit or its older sister, Hen-Lit. What is clear is that it has all the elements of a Chick-Lit romantic comedy. It has a confiding, personal tone, accomplished through compelling first person prose. Cat's flip, yet endearing attitude toward herself draws you into her story. Her feistiness, while a refreshing quality, could also be her undoing.Having suffered a devastating breakup with Josh, Cat is at an unsettled time in her life, and it is reflected in her business life. She is working part time in an antiques shop for Scotty, her gay best friend, and trying to make extra money writing a blog on the pitfalls of Internet Dating for her former magazine editor. At the same time, she has promised herself to write her dream book on Renaissance art when she gets around to it!When her path crosses that of Rick Blake, the handsome owner of Rick's Caf&eacute; ,she quickly learns that Scotty's description of the caf&eacute; as being ""like Casablanca"" was more telling than she could have imagined. Rick is not only mysterious, he is dangerously irresistible to Cat. Unfortunately, fate continually conspires to keep them apart. Will Cat's cheekiness  and Rick's dispassionate air work against each other? Are they destined to give up the great love of their lives - like in Casablanca?Told from the first person, ""Like Casablanca"" was entertaining and humorous. Sylvia Massara allowed her main character to be real. It was like listening to your closest friend filling you in on all the latest. Cat Ryan wallowed when she felt like it, was a good friend when she needed to be, and struggled to stay above water financially--just like most of us do even if we don't want to admit it. All the while, she never really gave up hope of finding someone special to share her life.The biggest complaint I had about Massara's writing is that she was so descriptive in describing food dishes that I wound up reading this book to the tune of my stomach growling!",1
159,4,"The author is definitely able to keep the tension high. Even the political manoeuvrings are tense, and there seems to be a lot more politics in this edition than previous. As the major players are trying to either regroup from the last major offensive, or simply trying to survive, alliances are made and broken, and the very existence of Earth is threatened. Can't wait for the next edition!",1
160,4,"The old adage goes 'Never judge a book by its cover.'  It actually refers to making assumptions about a person based on their looks, but in this case you can take it literally.  The back blurb of The Bull Years intrigued me but the cover didn't grab me at all.  It looked like it was going to be the life story of a Russian porn star.  Luckily for me I ignored my assumptions and decided to give the book a read.  You know what they say - assume makes an ass of u and me.  I would have been an ass if I didn't read this book based on its cover.  The Bull Years was surprisingly good.Not being one for reading fantasy, vampire novels, horror and science fiction, The Bull Years was exactly what I like - realistic fiction.  Realistic Contemporary Fiction.  The story is written from the points of view of four well-developed, utterly believable characters.  They are brought together by Steve Levine to participate in his 'Life Project.'  They have to go back into their past and confront one life-defining night at college which split their friendship and drove them apart.  The story covers two decades of their lives, interweaving each character's story together so that you end up with an excellent commentary of a generation.The sad fact of life is that the grandiose dreams you had at college remain just that.  Grandiose dreams.  Life is full of disappointments, relationships and jobs that never work out as planned.  Phil Stern manages to portray that brilliantly in The Bull Years.  While some parts might be a little dark, it is spiced with a wicked sense of humour that will have you chuckling out loud.The last paragraph of the novel was quite poignant.  ""So never think it's too late, or that your own life ultimately doesn't matter. Because who knows? You, all of you reading this Note now, could become the next Bull Personalities for some future generation, just as Steve, Dave, Sophia, and Dave have for us today.""The message is clear.  Don't let life's disappointments deter you.  There was a reason you were put on this planet.",1
161,5,"After reading ""Pestilence"" by Ken McClure, I definitely wanted to read ""Resurrection"" and I was not disappointed! It is one incredible story!This medical mystery has a rather unassuming doctor, Adam Dewar, investigating the source of a smallpox virus that threatens to bring the killer disease back to the world's population in horrendous fashion. Contemporary in nature, ""Resurrection"" involves the Iraqis and a Scottish medical research facility working on a vaccination for the AIDS virus.What is the connection between the two ... or is there a connection at all? Dewar thinks so; he does not believe in coincidence, but he has no evidence.  His investigation takes the reader around some dark corners and through lots of hills and valleys.The characters are quite believable and, unfortunately, so is the story. Pretty darn scary. I don't want to give up too much information ... that's for you to gather as you read this true page-turner.I was bothered a bit by some punctuation problems, specifically quotation marks denoting conversation.  But that will NOT detract from your reading enjoyment. Get the book and settle in for a great ride!One thing is for sure: I will be looking for more Ken McClure!",1

He quickly realizes that he will do whatever it takes to make her see him as something other than just the goofy guy next door.  So, when it looks like she isn't willing to entertain anything other than a quick fling, he takes on a predatory role that surprises everyone.  He calls in favors and kidnaps Pam to try to woo her into seeing things his way.Can he convince her that forever isn't just a dirty word and that he can be more than just a fling?I love the Granite Lake Wolves.  I am also one of the fans that have pestered Ms. Arend for TJ's story, as I have loved him since the first book.  Wolf Tracks does not disappoint.  I love how funny, easygoing TJ meets his match and mate when he least expects it, and that she is human.  I love how he comes up with a plan that quickly goes awry but makes the best out of it in the end.  I think Wolf Tracks is a fantastic addition the Granite Lake Wolves, and while it is a stand alone story I think everyone should read Wolf Signs so that you too can pull for TJ.TanyaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1

170,4,"I liked the first book a lot more than this one, though that is not to say I didn't like this one - I DID. But it didn't have as much romance in it as the first, and maybe that's why, since I tend to like books with more romance in it. I gotta say though, I LOVED THE riddles before each chapter, and then at the end it would give the riddle again and its answer. It made me think and I even got several answers correct! I wasn't quite satisfied with the end though because it seemed like even though there IS a happy ending, there was little time spent developing the relationship between Leonie and Douglas/Gideon. And I had a hunch he was the one she'd rescued all those years back; plus also finding out whom the kidnapper was - I'd guessed it correctly. It had good twists to the story, but I would have liked to see Leonie's and Gideon's relationship develops more. I cringed at the part where Leonie had to `hurt' one of her hands in order to escape; it reminded me a tiny bit of the movie Saw, though it's nowhere near as gruesome as that movie was, don't get me wrong. I've enjoyed reading the Moon Trilogy series by Bevill as well, and look forward to reading the others too.",1

The cover is just perfect and, though I usually don't really pay that much attention to covers, for some reason this one set the characters for me exactly and I could see them so well. I loved the relationship development here - and how each man comes to grip with what being out in a small town Texas environment could cost. The secondary characters were well drawn and this one had a lot of emotion. The dog was a bit of comedic relief and it was very funny at times. Edward was outwardly so sure of himself but inwardly full of doubts and wanting to really believe. Great read!",1

175,4,"This was great! It incorporated everything a full length book would give me without having all those slow parts I generally detest. The beginning gave the reader insight into the characters without wasting any time. Schroeder is master at giving the reader back story without slowing the novella down. I am not shy in saying that I often get worried when dealing with a book that is set on another planet, or an alternate universe or something of the like. Sometimes I feel as if the author tries to hard to get their vision of this type of world across, however, with this one Schroeder gives enough detail to set the stage but leaves room for the reader to envision their own details.The Last Detail is set in a future where the outcast, the troubled, the violent and the offenders have been exiled to other planets. Lou is one such outcast. Trying to earn her way back to earth by tracking down other offenders and hauling them in. She has been given an assignment that will allow her to finally accumulate enough credits to return to earth. Simply bring in a man accused of selling secrets. Sam Dawson. What she finds in Sam though isn't a criminal, she finds a man..one she might actually let into her scarred heart.Lou was a complex character. I liked that she had such well defined layers that were slowly stripped away by Lou and Jared. Did I forget to mention Jared? Heh. Jared is Lous boss and he is also Sams ex. These three together are hot hot hot! The dynamics between the three of them were very well wrote. Lou has major trust issues. Sam doesn't want to admit he wants someone for the long haul. Jared is the one that holds them together. He is the one that thinks logically and knows he needs them both in his life. Jared is softer while Sam is macho. Together they would make the most perfect man. Apart they make for a very hot smexy scene. Lou had her hands full....literally *snicker*.The Last Detail is a awesome novella that has it all...action, character development and smexy goodness that will make your heart stutter. I loved it!

181,4,"B movie type romance--so bad it's good.  I enjoyed this story a lot once I just went with the flow and stopped being annoyed by the ridiculous Me-Tarzan-You-Jane type dialogue and falling in love with your jailhouse gangbang.  Some of the humor is obviously intentional some of it not but all of it was highly entertaining for me.  Not that there weren't some genuinely sweet/romantic-ish moments from the heroine's group of protective alpha male suitors but anyone looking for a romance they can sigh over probably won't be happy with this.Even though I liked it a lot, there were definitely some editing problems and if the author's style doesn't click for you I can see people hating this book instead of enjoying it.  This is the third book in the series and does stand alone.  But here's the reading order for those who hate to read a series out of order:Enslaved1. Genesis (2007)2. The Spawning (2008)3.

197,4,"It's a bit a Fantasy Cowboy Land the one described in this book by T.A. Chase, but well, sometime it's good to forget that there are places in this world where you can't really be who you are without worrying of the consequences, and it's important to tell the story as you would like it to be, since maybe, time over time, you will change a mind at time.And so in this story we have Tyler and J.T., twin rodeo cowboys. Both handsome and gay (well actually, J.T. is bisexual...), J.T. is the shiny twin, while Tyler is the shy one. Tyler is also the responsible one, first his mother on her death bed and then his father asked him to take care of his twin, and Tyler always acted as guardian angel. He also left his beloved ranch, and his beloved neighbor Ren, to follow his twin on the rodeo circuit. But eight years after, Tyler is wondering if it's not time to come back at home, J.T. or not J.T. on tow.At home there is not only is aging father, but also Ren, the older and handsome neighbor who was Tyler's unrequited first love. Tyler has never had the courage to confess to Ren his feelings, instead he talked to J.T. who, soon after, seduced Ren. Now Tyler doesn't know if being happy to have a proof that Ren is gay, or be unhappy to be forced once again to compete with his twin.On the other hand, Ren is only waiting for Tyler to be old enough, and tired enough of the outside world, to be ready to settle down in their ranches. Ren is the older brother of three, but his two brothers have no intention to stay at the ranch. So Ren is ready and willing to build a family, and Tyler was always is first choice when arriving to a life partner. His relationship with J.T. was only a fling, and something that tired him soon after the first encounter.Ren has some personality issues, a legacy from his military service during war time, and he needs to be in control in every moment. On the other hand, Tyler needs to let the control sometime, since he is always the reliable twin, the one who everyone expected to take the right decision. In this way, Ren and Tyler are perfect together, being Ren always the top in their relationship, and Tyler the willing bottom.So no problem in their relationship and no problem also outside their relationship: Tyler's father behaves like a old fashioned father, means that he only asks Ren's intentions toward his son, and he is more than happy when he is assured that they are honest; Ren's brothers are only waiting for their brother to find a partner in order to be able to move out of the ranch without worrying to leave their brother alone... Sure, there is no the time, or the chance, to see the behavior of who is not a strict relative, other than one of Tyler's friend, but the atmosphere of all the book is of a total acceptance of Ren and Tyler's love.Setting and details are very accurate, with few right positioned words, T.A. Chase gives the reader all the necessary details to be deeply immerse in the rodeo and breeding horse culture.",1

If it would have been a longer novel, then it could have expanded into more details, but it did state at the beginning that she was writing down a little of her life and how she became the way she was - not her whole life story.  If the author ever expanded it to be a full length novel, I think it would be a good one.But back to the short story form ... For a short story, I found it a very good read.  There isn't a lot of room in a short story to create a full background and all the details involved in one's life.  This book was more along the line of the main character sitting down with you and briefly telling you a little about their life so you know a little about them without all the details.

209,5,"Thin Air was a great read.  I enjoyed every minute of this book.  It kept me company while on a plane ride.  Since the main character was an air spirit it seemed suitable to read the book while in an airplane up in the clouds.What I liked:* The use of elementals.  Usually I read books that have vampires, fairies, angels, or something like that.  In this book the main character is a sylphid.  The book references elementals that represent fire, earth, water, and air.  I hadn't read a book like this before and I was quite taken.* Characters.  I love a good character and this book was full of them.  Aeris is the main character and the story is told by her.  As an air spirit she is the envy of all the females and all the males want to be her mate.  As a human she is beautiful.  She comes across as a little naive but that is just because she has to learn how to be human. She has to learn about eating, wearing clothes, saying the right things, and reading.  As an air spirit she was confident and in control.  As a human she is unsure and helpless.  She does have a moment towards the end where she displays her confidence and control.  Daniel is a human who captures Aeris's heart.  Daniel is in a relationship that isn't all that great.  He is such a nice guy that he seems a push over at times.  He has great qualities that I like.  He is a musician which is a plus.  He is loyal, supportive, and he even has a piggy collection.  What is not to like?  Oh yeah, he has green eyes.  I am a goner there.  Another great character that didn't get much time but made an impact on me none the less is Terra.  Terra is an earth dwelling sylph that helps Aeiris seek the king of the gnomes so she can become human. Terra is a character that for a moment I wished Aeris would love.  I would love to know more about him.  As a human Aeiris assumes the name Alice.  One of Alice's first friends is Dante.  Dante is someone I would want as a friend.  He has style and sass.  His comments on certain events in the story had me snickering.* The overall story line drew me in.  I am usually not a sucker for love at first sight but in this book it worked for me.  I guess because Alice was not human at the time she first laid eyes on Daniel made the difference for me.  She was curious about Daniel and his green eyes sealed the deal (I'm a sucker for green eyes).  I also liked that when Alice was finally human and sought Daniel out she had to work for it.  Daniel was in a relationship already even though it wasn't a good one.  She had to fight for him.  The aspect of elements played out throughout the whole story.  Alice found that she was not the only one who ever left the elemental realm for love.  The author provided themes of love, diversity, tolerance, and friendship all in a wonderful package of a story.What I didn't like:  As Aeris/Alice becomes human there are times in the story where she shows that she doesn't understand being human and does silly things but then in other instances she knows exactly what is going on.  For example, she doesn't know how to open a can of soda since as an air spirit they don't hunger or thirst.  Someone shows her how to open the can.  She doesn't know to open the sugar packet before putting it in her coffee so she puts the whole packet in.  At another time she sees someone using a cell phone and  knows exactly what it is.  It's just a little thing to notice but I figured if she was truly learning about being human why would she know what a cell phone is when she saw someone using one?  This by no means took away from me liking the story.  It was just a little inconsistency that I thought about while reading.My overall feeling about this story is that I loved it.  I liked the use of elementals.  The story was just the right amount of romance, action, and humor.  I recommend Thin Air to everyone who loves to read a great story.I received the book from the author for an honest review",1

213,5,"I&#8217;ve read several books now by Sara Brookes and Ragged Edge is my absolute favorite. The dynamics in this book is incredible. No meet, hop in bed and HEA in 24 hours or less here. The time span of the story takes place over several months so you know there is time for their relationship to evolve naturally. The character development of Dalton, Cade and Erin is very well detailed. They are all less than perfect filled insecurities and flaws that make them feel very real. No doubt there is a connection between all the characters but the author presents their story in such a way I instantly connected to them as well. Really, my favorite parts are their story. Yes the sex is hot (see below) but instead of feeling very rushed bits mixed between hot sex I felt Ms Brookes took her time to present their story in such a way that you can get to know the players as individuals instead of cardboard sex toys.This is one HAWT book! So without further ado look forward to reading about M/M,. F/F, M/F and the best parts&#8230;M/F/M. There is also some BDSM, sex toys, bondage and anal play. The sexual heat will curl your toes. But it&#8217;s not all about the Spank-O-Vision or the bow-chica-wow-wow it&#8217;s the emotional connection between Dalton, Cade and Erin that makes the sex sizzling hot.This book is a must read.

215,4,"I absolutely loved these books.  I was delighted with the first book. It was a fast, funny haha, laugh-out-loud read.  I loved the characters.  So when i found that the same characters where in the rest of the books, i was happily surprised.  What can i tell you about these books?  The main character takes being ditzy to a fine art.  the main hero.. hot.. the bad guys are scary.. and it takes awhile to figure out who they are.. i guess i'm just going around in circles here.  just want to say i laughed a lot.  loudly.",1

218,5,"The Trouble with Tomboys by Linda Kage was OUTSTANDING. It was hilarious, heartfelt, and touching. This book had me laughing and crying at the same time. Sometimes I was laughing so hard I'd cry. Other times I was bawling my eyes only to start cracking up seconds later. It was a wonderful emotional rollercoaster ride.I loved the two main characters, B.J. the tomboy and Grady the widower. Ms. Kage did a fabulous job showcasing Grady's feelings for both Amy, his dead wife, and B.J., his feisty new baby momma. I strongly felt his torment, his grief, and his sense of betrayal, as well as his happiness, his excitement, and his love. I liked watching his character gradually come back to life. His feelings and the changes in his life felt so raw and realistic. I couldn't help but fall for him. I also really liked B.J. She's loud, blunt, lively, and sometimes inappropriate. I consider myself a girly girl, but that didn't stop me from respecting and relating to B.J.'s character.I gave The Trouble with Tomboys by Linda Kage 4 STARS. I absolutely loved this novel, and I strongly recommend this original and entertaining tale. I liked this novel so much that I am currently reading another Linda Kage novel, How to Resist Prince Charming.-XOXOREADING, EATING & DREAMINGFOR MORE REVIEWS CHECK OUT MY BLOG ON BLOGSPOT: READING, EATING & DREAMING I WAS BLAIR WALDORF",1

227,4,"It was the cover of this book that caught my attention.  It's clean and to the point and, being an environmental studies grad, I couldn't pass by.Daily life in England some 30 years after the Upheaval is still recognisable, but there are some noticeable differences.  There is nothing new, everything is used, re-used and then re-used again and again.  All manufacturing has ceased and residents of England are dependent on the cast offs of their neighbours, but many items are becoming un-usable.  The structure is pushed to the limits and something is bound to break.Celia and her husband Robin have been feeling this strain and are no longer complacent about their lot in this well ordered life.This new society didn't really seem like much of a stretch from being possible.  Some people would come out better and others would be worse off, but on average, would most people really notice especially after a few decades.I liked the way that author Glenis Stott introduced the concept of no choice in your life and that there was no benefit to people taking initiative.  Even that the population in the cities were losing the basic skills of how to care for their belongings, since nothing belonged to them.This novel is an example of the characters within the book carrying a good concept too far.",1

232,4,"Exciting para supernatural read that is fast paced and interesting. The main character Lockman is suddenly confronted with a child he never knew he had and now someone is using that same child to try and get to him. I enjoyed the read, although the last chapter or so it seemed as if the ideas were piling on top of each other to reach a super climax, which it didn't need because the story was solid as it was. The only things that caught my attention that I think may rattle one or two sensitive cages was the reference to the well known dictators murder technique, which I thought was borderline risque and I think some readers may find it offensive as it glorifys the idea as a good one. The other thing I found unnecessary was a comment made by the ghost about how women feel when in a certain state of arousal. It didn't have anything to do with the storyline. Aside from that I recommend both the story and the writer. I received a free copy of this book for my review.",1

He's rough and tough and has had a hard life and our heroine Selena teaches him what love is. Their passion is so hot it will steam up your kindle. It takes you back to your first love and you can feel the butterflies in your stomach as you read.This is a must read,1

However, you can get this story in the similarly GNS CHAPTER STYLEDThe Beasts and the Dead. It includes this one and a lot more. Eric S.

240,5,"Oh, I really enjoyed this one!  From the very beginning it was dangerous and full of adventure.  I love it when a book grabs me in the beginning and I have a tough time setting it aside to do other things and I'm just waiting for the opportunity to pick it up again.  I think it was the whole 'Sword of Damocles' notion of waiting for the poor innocent to figure out what was going on when he learns of his betrayal on two counts plus the other hero's untenable position he is put into through no fault of his own that requires him to either get really lucky to come out with life and what means more than his life intact.The story opens with 'Mike' a Covert Operative for the Alliance working with a few other deep infiltrators to gain recon info to help a group of the natives against the big Doctrine war machine seeking to take over the planet.  Mike's from the Alliance whose presence on this independent planet is not supposed to be known.  Mike is supposed to gain intel for others which he does and in so doing his intel brings a change in his orders.  Now he is supposed to seduce a Doctrine officer and use him to learn about troop movements, supplies, plans, etc.  This doesn't sit well with him, but its orders and he'll follow them.Sergei is a young captain and the invading Doctrine Army General's assistant.  He is eager with this new posting and hoping to see some action.  That is until the general forces relations on him that he can't say 'no' to or face drastic consequences.  When the general takes a leave to return to the home world, Sergei breathes a sigh of relief and suddenly finds himself propositioned by a mysterious scholar who may be more than he seems.  Sergei sees something different in Mike and decides to tempt danger and take a chance with him.  It is with Mike that Sergei learns all that he has been missing out on in his dreary life.  Soon, he comes to trust Mike deeply and finds a way to keep him close, but in the meantime his rejection of the General brings dire consequences.  And it is not long before the horrifying truth is revealed making Sergei wonder if death or oblivion are entirely bad things.This riveting plot alternates between both Sergei and Mike's points of view.  It was so important to have both men's perspectives and feelings for this story to work.  It would have been very difficult for the characters to garner my liking and sympathy without having access to their motives.  Mike and Sergei represent two opposing ideologies though they still manage to connect on a fundamental level and it is that connection which makes the story go from average to amazing when their backgrounds are teased out and they should be hated enemies.The authentic military backdrops of the guerilla warfare in the mountains and the big army muscle steamrolling all before them with the operatives like Mike ghosting around I thought were a great enhancement to the story.  That whole Doctrine world with its 'live this way or face the consequences' was scary stuff to me and just ratcheted up the tension for me as Mike and Sergei's story unwound before me.As to the secondary characters, I thought they were good too.  That general- I loathed him and found myself giving him a mental death wish for what he did to Sergei.  Mike's compatriot Pat and Sergei's aunt were pretty straight forward, but I couldn't help but feel ambivalent about several others.  There were three individuals that I could have wished to know more about because in the end I still wasn't ultimately sure about them and wanted to know if my suspicions were correct.  I don't wish to speculate further and create spoilers and in the end further detail about these folk didn't affect the resolution.It is a Sci-Fi though I couldn't help, but feel that other than the technology and the creatures that it could have been almost any genre because of the stronger elements in it that were universal- the military feel as one army came to conquer another, covert operatives from another army, freedom fighters, forbidden romance, and corruption.  This observation is not meant as a criticism since it truly was a wonderful story and the Sci-Fi tones were strongly present.  I guess what I'm trying to say in a wandering sort of way is that more than Sci-Fi lovers would enjoy this book.  So to whom do I recommend this story?  Almost everyone!",1

I felt like I was Xan being rejected, sad and upset but yet, on the other hand, I also felt Catherine's hesitations and reservations.  To truly be Xan's she would have to submit wholly to him and forever belong to the pride.  I just kept asking myself ""Could I leave everything behind to enter a world that makes New York look tame?""The only downside was the anticlimactic fight with the Underlord demon in chapter 22.

It feels like she is back in time , she has to sort this all out, if she makes one mistake it can alter her entire future. A fantastic romantic mystery with some paranormal aspects. Altogether a fun, sad read if you love romance books I highly recommend you read the dream.",1
247,4,"I didn't give this a three star rating because for a short read (a couple of hours), it was entertaining. The problems I found were threefold: the occasional missing word, the formatting needs work, and the punctuation needs looking at (particularly with the dialogue). But those issues could be glossed over in this tidy little tale. I also felt the ending could use a little more explanation, but the writing is very smooth and the journey of the main character (a zombie) was a nice change from the normal groans for brains. If you like zombie stories, you'll find this an unusual take on the subject. Even better that this was free!",1
248,5,"This is an interesting paranormal gay romance in the fact that one of the main characters have to overcome his feelings over being gay. The inner conflict really made it a lot more interesting and I loved reading it.It gave me everything I crave in a paranormal romance. There is a huge connection between the mated characters, and there is plenty of action and adventure as well as a danger they must face.Overall it was a really good read and left me feeling good.",1
249,5,"I found this to be an enjoyable read, and even though I suspected the killer about halfway through the book, the story line moved quickly. I found most of the characters to be well-developed, and even though I found certain aspects unbelievable, I could forgive them as I felt they added to the storyline.",1
250,5,"These are so much better than the ones that I had. First, they come with 3 sizes of detachable ear buds so you can get the perfect fit. It is so nice not to have ear buds falling out. These fit great. I don't need to have the volume as loud to block out other noise. The real test was today at work. It's a Friday afternoon, people are restless and loud and I have work to do. I popped these in and didn't have to crank the volume up and could just hear my music. I always just use the ear buds that come with whatever I buy. It's nice to have some decent ones for a change. Definitely recommend these.",1
251,5,"Jeez. Addison's writing is absolutely breathtaking. I know I've said this before, but I've truly never read anything like it. It's so sharp, witty, raw, and sometimes morbid...in a good way. Her descriptions of Paragon are incredible. Paragon feels like this amazing island I get to travel to every few months. It's solemn and rainy and I love it.This is the book in the series when I fell in love with Gage. He is so sweet and sincere, truly dedicated to Skyla (and hot as sin - raven hair, cobalt blue eyes, deep dimples - swoon!). At least he doesn't pull the stunts Logan does in this book and Ethereal. Although, it's hard to find fault in Logan when his reasoning always sounds so logical. But still! Ugh, he frustrates me. Okay, sorry. I'll try to make sense. We also get to meet the seductively powerful Sector, Marshall, in Tremble. Marshall is just brilliant and sexy and wicked - love him!Thus, the love triangle...er, rectangle begins. In order to keep Skyla safe, Logan decides the best course of action is to pretend they aren't romantically involved. Logan's brilliant idea on how to achieve this goal? Why, Skyla should be pretend-dating Logan's cousin, Gage, of course! The same Gage that has had visions of himself and Skyla being in love and getting married. I don't see what could possibly go wrong here...Enter Marshall who has a plan of his own involving Skyla's future marital bliss, and the plot thickens. Okay, that was lame, my apologies. Moving on, Marshall also claims he's on Paragon to protect Skyla against the Countenance - the angel faction hell-bent on harvesting Skyla for her powerful, pure Celestra blood. But if Marshall's seeking Skyla's affection, he sure has an odd way of showing it.There's not much going on as far as the war against the Counts in this book, but there are plenty of fantastical plot lines and drama and creepiness to keep us entertained. If you haven't started this series, you must go pick it up now. I have never anticipated book releases the way I do with this series. The first six books are out now with the seventh book, Toxic, releasing later this summer. Squee!! Can't wait! Addison has stated there will be eight books total in the Celestra series. So sad that it's almost over; I'll miss these characters painfully.",1
252,4,"The story line was a ctually pretty cool, as is the story line for the next book. However it seems almost half the book is sex scenes. Yes, they are steamy and very descriptive, but like I said they take up half the books and it kinda takes a little away from the rest of the story.",1

254,4,"Review by Valerie:  It's official for me, novella = extra long teaser. This was a stunning paranormal novella introducing us to the world of immortals and witches. While many novellas are written to expand on characters from other storylines, this one is a stand alone (fingers crossed there will be more from this author).I loved the descriptions of the world that Lucien and Aisleen inhabit. I was taken in by her ability as a healer and his kindness despite being a warrior. When he is betrayed and their paths cross, their destiny is decided for them...yet all is not as it seems. Aisleen knows Lucien's true identity which causes her unspeakable sorrow. As these characters spend more time together, you can't help but root for them to get to know each other better and try to figure out a way to make amends - as impossible as it seems.The ending of the novella certainly leaves us wanting more and wondering how both of these characters will handle betrayal and attraction and what other obstacles they will face before they find happiness, if ever.",1

257,4,"This was a wonderful story, great characters, nice storyline and well thought out. The passion was too thin for me personally, but I would recommend it highly. I wish I could rate this 4.75 because it deserves it. There was a few grammar errors but they looked liked something the computer skipped over. Great read though and will read it again.",1
258,4,I thought this was a very endearing story and loved both the plot and all the characters.  The only issue I had was the interaction between this grown young woman of 20 and her abusive mother.  It just didn't ring true for me.  Since it was a rather minor part of the story it didn't detract terribly and I would still recommend this book.,1

I guarantee that you will at least like it, if not love it.",1
260,4,"I thought this was a great idea for a book.  It was a cute story.  It was fun to read how the main character, although, unhappy at first about being entered in to the bridesmaid lotto, eventually embraced it and was determined to enjoy the exciting experiences that came her way.",1
261,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the stories written by this author. I saved this book for the last. The author did an excellent job in developing the characters and the scenes. I do have one thing that after a while I skipped over. I know that the history of Bayou Billy was in there to give character background of the man, but there were times, that I just skipped over it. After the first few interviews I got the point of what type of character the man had. I don't know how else they could have been entered other than maybe one of the main characters reading an interview throughout the book. I would read anything this author writes! Especially the Bubba books!",1
262,5,"In the interest of full disclosure, this was a free offer from Amazon that I took advantage of, thinking that like most of the free books, it would be fair at best.  Wrong!  This is a well written thriller with a protagonist that is both vulnerable and unshakable.  The plot builds at a very nice pace and the introduction of additional characters is done extremely well.  Maybe I'm stupid, but had not figured out what the various antagonist were up until very near the end.I have to mention that fact that whoever converted this book to e-format is to be complimented and should be hired by other independent authors.  It is almost flawlessly edited, grammar checked and actually formatted properly.  I know it sometimes sounds trite to criticize any book that costs $3 but I've read some that were so bad I tossed them into the virtual trashcan.  Pacing is very important in the enjoyment of a book and having slopping and unprofessional editing disrupts that pacing to the point of distraction.As I mentioned in the header, my only disappointment was when I went to look for other books by this author and hopefully in this series only to find he has only one other book out and it's a young adult novel.  I sincerely hope he's  not a one hit wonder as so many independent authors are.  So, if you've read this book and enjoy it as much as I did, please encourage the author through positive reviews and even private emails.",1

I could especially relate to the motherhood aspect of the stories, and I will fully admit that I've been known to ""Hulk-out,"" too. This collection may be a good bet if you'd like to get to know Barb before deciding if her murder mystery series is right for you. It's a great introduction to the characters and the type of writing you'll see in the full-length novel. There are also a few bonus stories at the end that follow a completely different type of writing style, and it gives the reader a sense of the author's other capabilities as a writer.",1

270,5,"A prequel within a sequel, answers to questions considered from Divine Intervention with its many references to The Parliament Murders. This second book begins with an unconscious leader of a PSI team of the Canadian Federal Bureau of Investigation (CFBI), Jasmine (Jasi) McLellan. She has been hospitalized after the gunshot wound she received in the previous book went sour and developed a serious blood infection. Even worse, it was discovered on this second trip to hospital that she also had a concussion with brain swelling. Doctors are non-committal at this point, but a threat does hang over her that if they can't stop the infection from spreading to her heart, they are looking at amputation. This is enough to terrify her friend and co-worker, Victim Empath Natassia Prushenko, and seriously affect her other partner Ben Roberts, top profiler and Psychometic Empath. Three months have gone by since Natassia joined the PSI team, working on the case that had been solved only weeks ago, leaving Jasi with her injuries. In her coma, she is living in the prequel, reliving The Parliament Murders, while friends and family are living in the sequel to the first book. They are in the present, which happens to be July, 2012.I am one reader of probably a large number of readers who really wanted to learn the story of The Parliament Murders, and now we have it.

I love this concept, giving us the earlier story through Jasi's coma, and perhaps her subconscious feelings of guilt. At the same time we are getting snippets of what is happening with the rest of the team waiting and watching over her.  The high suspense factor of The Parliament Murders is heart-pounding and the desperation to solve the case is every bit as exciting, though told through Jasi's mind. Someone is killing off the Canadian Members of Parliament in Ottawa, one by one, and doing a nasty job of it, too. What is the connection between the victims? A reason doesn't seem to be forthcoming. This is the case that bothers Jasi so much.  The story is well focused, fast-paced, a real thriller. The action and race against time happening in Jasi's mind is underscored by the perception of the slow passage of time by her friends, family, and medical staff, waiting, fearing. A dramatic conflict of perceived time.One thing I like about series is how the characters grow and become familiar. It's somewhat like adding people to your group of friends or family. This is also true in a working community, especially in a high risk group who provide a safety net for each others' lives. These PSI investigators are definitely a family, tuned in to each member's needs, and abilities. We met them in Divine Intervention and learn a little more about them as they wait for Jasi to wake up. Another great psi-fi thriller from Cheryl Kaye Tardif.",1
271,5,"As a fan of Larson's Starforce series I was eager to start the Haven series and I'm so glad I did!!! The fantasy world Larson has created is an amazing place where Humans, Wee Folk, Goblins, Elves, and a host of other unique races make for a truly amazing ride!I've already completed the first four books in the series and am currently half way through Book 5, and I can honestly say it has been a joy to immerse myself in this amazing fantasy epic!As an avid reader and writer (Hyperactive) of Scifi and fantasy I can honestly say that Larson has taken the familiar themes of the genre and gave it a fresh and exciting overall. The plot is engaging, the characters both good and bad are endearing, and the action is non stop!I highly recommend this series and am looking forward to each new installment!",1
272,5,"I enjoyed this book . kinda of a mystery but not. 3 teenagers with powers they acquire when their growth stops. all different. A Dr who is deranged with a god complex tracking them because he infected them when they were born for what he thinks will be his personal supernatural army. it goes quit the other way as the kids group together and become more of super hero types as their digging into their births and anyone involved in this project they were born I to.it turns out to be a interesting, adventurous story. very smart kids who just want rtf he truth.this is not the end however, it seems to just be getting started with this book. their are more kids to find and the Dr is not caught yet. he's Avery dangerous man and the kids will not let him hurt their families which I think is going to be a next exciting book.very well written. fast paced, adventurous and interesting. filled with imagination.I was given t his book for a honest review.",1

274,5,"Well done, nice quality, brightly colored graphics!  Each letter includes an object that begins with that letter - most of these are everyday items (animals, food, etc) that young children can easily identify.Love the idea of using these over the traditional paper flashcards which seem to always be tattered or missing cards.  The only thing I miss being able to do is to 'mix up the stack' to give your child more of a challenge.  I suppose you could just hit the point button at the bottom and show whatever comes up sporadically, it just seems sort of awkward to do so.  Of course, this is also a great book for getting started and becoming familiar with letters.",1
275,5,"Book Review: Zachary Pill - The Dragon At Station End, Trilogyby Tim GreatonReviewed by J Bryden LloydWriting Style - 4.5/5.0 (Excellent)In previous works I have read by this author, I have found the writing style to be easy-flowing and very strong. Again, with this offering, Mr Greaton has battered the proverbial nail into submission.The structure of the chapters really makes this into a great book for bedtime, if you are the sort of parent who reads to the kids each night. Some are a little longer, but not significantly, and every chapter close leaves you wanting a little more.Character Development - 5.0/5.0 (Outstanding)The characters are full and realistic from the outset and the author builds each of them carefully  but accurately, into a group of relatable people. For the non-human characters (which takes up 95% of the cast) you are given your reasons to like and dislike each of them. Even the baddies have some positive attributes, but in the grand scheme of things, surely the good guys have to win... don't they?If you are looking for the best in character development from a character who doesn't even play an active role, look no further than Medusa. That really was a touch of sublime excellence.Descriptive - 4.5/5.0 (Excellent)If you want a world opening up to your imagination, this is a must-read. Although the background is effectively inner-city and small-town USA, the world created around it is superbly written. The author creates all the sights and sounds, tastes and sensations with great skill.The sequences in the tunnels and caves are brilliant, and really serve to bring forth the action and enhance the scene for the reader.As for the general descriptive; I had no problem visualising every element within the story. From buildings to countryside, cleaning to fighting, everything was drawn with ornate skill and attention to detail.Language & Grammar - 4.5/5.0 (Excellent)Undoubtedly a book for the younger readers - though I would suggest not TOO young - this is a strong example of how to bring literature to the children who are perhaps now just starting to discover characters like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson and Artemis Fowl.Older children would have no issues reading this unassisted and in the same way, it is an easy, enjoyable read for the parents as well.A new edition is imminent, which will address the handful of grammatical and spelling issues I noticed. Once out, this will be a quite exceptional piece of literature.Plot - 4.5/5.0 (Excellent) - MINOR SPOILERSWho is Zachary Pill? More importantly, WHAT is Zachary Pill? To be honest, you never really find out, though there are plenty of clues handed out to lead you towards obvious conclusions. Unfortunately, just as you think you are beginning to put two-and-two together, a whole new element is thrown into the mix and you end up with seven!!The plot is excellent. It's original, fast-moving, nicely balanced, and it leaves the reader very satisfied with the end result.As it turns out, Pill is the next generation of a former ruler from another world; a world inexorably linked to all the other worlds (where a variety of creatures reside) by a series of great corridors, which are controlled by the wizards. This forms the basis for the underlying plot in these three stories, expertly linked together into this full-length novel.By the end, I guarantee you'll be wanting more... MUCH more!General - 4.5/5.0 (Excellent)I don't care what anyone says, this ISN'T Potter, and it definitely isn't a cobbling together of a children's version of Lord of the Rings and anything else either.What makes this impressive, is that it takes what some may see as familiar elements, orcs, gnomes, wizards, trolls, werewolves, etc, and zooms off in a whole new direction. For me, the nicest little touch was the reference to traveling to Europe, where there were wizard schools for humans... I got a nice chuckle out of that.No. If you are going to read Zachary Pill, clear your mind of all that `expelliarmus' and `Mordor' stuff, and strap yourself in for a fun ride into a wholly different world. If you don't like this, I'll be amazed.FIVE stars... of course.",1
276,4,"I love novellas. They usually give us a chance to get a more in depth look at a supporting character and in this case, Ethan Wate's best friend, Wesley Lincoln...aka Link. I absolutely love Link so anything I can get with him in it, I'm game. I would have read this even if it was about Linkubus. Yes, if you haven't read this you're probably looking at me like I'm crazy. Linkubus is a nickname he gave himself and I have to say, I absolutely adore this nickname! He's now a quarter incubus and it's just such a creative, catchy name. It's so Link, as well. It fits his personality perfectly.This is a book, still told from Ethan's point of view, but about how Link realized what had happened to him at the end of BEAUTIFUL DARKNESS. It's quite amusing and you get to see an inside look at his family life with his nutty mother. We also get to see Link and Macon Ravenwood interact a lot and I think I'm going to like this...friendship? I cannot wait to read BEAUTIFUL CHAOS and I totally see how this would've held over people until it was released!If you're a fan of this series and want something short, fun and all about Link (for the most part), read this! It's nothing something you'd have to read if you follow the series but it's something fun you should read! If you haven't pick up BEAUTIFUL CREATURES then, well, what are you waiting for? Highly recommend this series!",1
277,4,"The story starts off with Mallory, a trade witch, the lowest of the low, with no money for high-end magic spells, and even worse, no familiar to boost her magic power, and in order to make ends meet, Mal sometimes works at a bar called the Python Palace. It is here that she enters a mysterious room, one normally off limits, but tonight her boss, Rattler, tells her to go rest there after her shift.Mal stretches out and soon falls asleep; she awakens to find herself in a new place, a much different place where these gray-skinned aliens reside. And these are not the little gray men aliens. No, these men are tall, muscular and almost reptilian in looks, with fangs and black-slitted eyes. The hero, Core, is the War Leader, a type of king in this world, and he has a huge snake tattooed on his chest. Not only is Core able to transform into something that appears both human and snake-like at the same time, his tat can even embody a powerful snake spirit that moves off his chest and becomes alive.I was fascinated by this idea of a snake-shifter. To be honest, snakes don't normally go hand-in-hand with sexy for me, but Core managed to pull it off. He kind of reminded me of a tough biker mixed with deadly warlord. Not only was he badazz and sexy, he was also sweet and protective of Mal. It turned out that he and Mal were each exactly what the other needed, in several ways, leading to a very sexy and magical relationship.This story is only 79 pages, but it gets a lot of story into those pages. Sure, sometimes it can seem a little rushed, but overall, the story is pretty creative and very interesting. Actually, it ended with me very much wanting to know more about this alien world, about a few of Core's fighters/friends, and most of all, wanting to find out more about this rival race called the Phrellians. There is definitely a lot more here for the author to revisit, and even room for her to go deeper. Rattler definitely needs a story.For a dollar, this was really a nice surprise. It had some action, interesting characters, and this other world, making for an intriguing mix of PNR with alien romance. And I have to say I've never read a book with a snake-shifter before, just very different to have this oddly sexy snake-man as a hero. All in all, a pretty good read,  short and hot, with a lot going for it, especially for the price. I'm not disappointed I bought it.",1
278,5,"This is a spellbinding tale of intrigue, kidnapping, danger, passion and of course, love. Michael and Hannah are two complex characters I thoroughly enjoyed!",1
279,4,Good read. It didn't keep me on edge at all but it was a fair free read. Not going past book to an I noticed the series continues a bit and I don't see myself spending a measly 2.99 to read something I wasn't that into. I gave it four stars because it written well and it had character depths bit the story line was not latching on in my mind to well. It seemed like I read this a million times. But if your looking for something to do to pass time it is that kind of book and 1st one is .99 second one was free so if you have a 12 hr. shift to pull then go for I and do and download.,1

287,4,"I bought this book for two reasons: 1. It's set in Boston and written by a local. 2. The characters act out rape fantasies.It met my expectations completely on both accounts. Boston was a living, breathing character and the rape scenes were deliciously dark and satisfying.Laurel White is nearly thirty but she's spinning her wheels working as a waitress at a tourist trap. She hasn't been able to make a relationship work long-term and she's stuck living with two roommates in a small apartment in the North End. When she sees a bruiser of a construction worker break up an escalating lovers' spat at a downtown park, she's immediately drawn to him, following after him to ask him on a date. He initially turns her down, but when she presses him, he writes an address on a napkin and hands it to her:""'Friday and Saturday nights, eight to one. Tell the guy working that Flynn invited you...If that doesn't scare you off,' he said, 'you can try askin' me out again.'""As it turns out, Flynn has invited her to one of his boxing matches - held in the basement of a South Boston dive bar - and to meet Pam, the woman he has rough sex with. Before he gets involved with her, he's letting her know just what sort of beast she's poking at. When Pam invites Laurel to watch her and Flynn ""scratch each other's kinky itches,"" that night, Laurel agrees to go, intrigued despite herself.Laurel and Flynn then forge a ""friends with benefits"" sort of arrangement where she explores a hitherto unknown part of herself that is unspeakably turned on by rape fantasy.The book is in third person, but told exclusively from the heroine's point of view. Flynn is a chatty Cathy (while somehow managing to stay the strong silent type as well, not sure how that happened) so he's made completely real to the reader despite the lack of his POV. Being in Laurel's head is integral to enjoying the unorthodox sex scenes. Watching Flynn with another woman would have been off-putting if the reader didn't know how much Laurel enjoyed the spectacle. The forceful rape scenes - complete with fighting, spitting, and name-calling - would have been disturbing without the firm assurance that Laurel felt completely safe and was completely on board.As a result of the focused POV, the book relies strongly on dialog, and does a smashing job of it. When Laurel expresses her nervousness, Flynn calms her nerves in a way that both explains what they're doing and gives a glimpse into the kind of person Flynn is:""'Neither of us is here to prove anything,' he said. 'We're here to have fun, and for you to maybe get your motor cranked like you never knew it could be. Or not. Who knows? My ego's not tied up in this going a certain way. The only thing that makes me nervous is hurting you by mistake, and I trust myself enough to think that's unlikely.'""The characters are constantly communicating and nearly all of the character development comes through in their own words. Since they're basically talking it out with me, they felt especially real. Flynn was pitch-perfect working-class Boston as well. The bit where he intentionally held up another driver on Laurel's tiny North End street just to be a jerk was classic. I lawled.Where the book fell apart for me was the ending. Ms. McKenna may insist she writes erotica and not erotic romance, but whatever she intended, she's effectively written 90% of an erotic romance. Just as the characters are admitting feelings for each other, exposing vulnerabilities and showing greater insight into who they are, the book ends without much of a resolution to it. It's not completely devoid of a HFN, but to end a book 5 pages after introducing a number of new character revelations? Not nice. Sure neat and tidy is ultimately forgettable, but you can have resolution *and* leave open possibilities at the same time. I was just the teeniest bit frustrated after finishing it.",1
288,4,"I've read entirely too many coming-of-age novels lately because I went into this one interested, but feeling like I'd read it all... yeah, not so much. This is more than a teenage girl finding herself, more than a the average 18-year-old finding himself. It's about a group of up-and-coming 20-somethings who help each other find themselves through love, laughter and fun.The start of the book is a little rough. It takes a while to get used to the ""episodes"" and it felt a little disjointed at first. I started out thinking it really could have used an overhaul to truly be successful as a novel. It also felt too short in places, but I usually feel that way about airy reads such as this.Having said that, this was a breath of fresh air. It was an easy read, the characters were all strongly written and the plot was well thought-out. I found myself alternatively loving and hating the characters, but always coming back to how real they felt. I didn't always agree with all of their decisions and directions, but it always made me smile.I recommend this chicklit book for those who want an easy read and a few smiles.",1
289,5,"I wasn't expecting to like this book. It had two strikes against it: 1) It's a relatively short book and 2) although I really love Gay Rocker fiction, I've been disappointed, lately, by the depressing and dreadful books that I've read, recently, in that genre.Thank you, Jet Mykles for making both of my reservations irrelevant in this wonderful, fun read.This book has everything I look for in Gay Rocker fiction, a hot, bigger-than-life, rock star, an appealing love interest who thinks he's really straight, and a growing love story that is both erotic and emotionally satisfying. I love the way Tyler just cannot believe that his rock idol is really falling in love with him - the &#34;regular guy&#34; he sees himself as. It's also refreshing that Tyler simply doesn't know that he's beautiful.But of course, we do. As does the rock star, Johnnie Heaven, he of the waist-length hair, beautiful, ripped, sexy shaved body and huge endowment.Look, this book does not solve world hunger or cure cancer. It does, however, deliver a few hours of erotic and emotional reading pleasure - more than many books with hundreds more pages. And, lest I forget to mention it, the book is very, very well-written, edited and paced.I can't wait to read the next in the series. Looks like I'll have plenty to occupy me over the next several days!",1

I may also be even more interested in the Rain series since I spent some years in Tokyo and know some of the scenes.",1
293,5,"This book made me emotional. There was one part that made me actually sob out loud (which just DOES NOT happen). There was so much in this book. Sorrow, anger, plotting, hatred, responsibility, humor...it just goes on and on. I felt like I was on a roller coaster of emotions when I read this book. I thought a book about a woman and a cat changing bodies would be light reading, but not so. I loved the writing style of this author as well as the entertainment value of the book. A great read!",1
294,5,"Funny, well written enjoyable book about an unlikely sleuth.  I have become hooked on humorous mysteries after years of reading the darker thrillers.  I like a book with a good plot and likeable characters and a sense of humor.  This book has all of that.Mrs. Harts writing is easy to get into and the book is a fun read.  I keep thinking of the old I Love Lucy show when reading the book.  Some of that may be the cover art but more likely it is the way things just seem to happen to Maddie.  I kept expecting her husband Neil to break into ""Maddie you go some splaining to do"".  Not a bad thing as I remember the show from its original run and still find it funny today.  I think Mrs. Hart may have a winner in Maddie and Neil.Get it.  Read it. Enjoy it.  Get the next one.Now Mrs. Hart just write more.",1

296,5,"I really loved this book. I had never read an 'angel' novel before and found it fascinating. I loved the idea of a 'dark angel' and the idea of him becoming irrevocably drawn to a mortal. I will definitely be looking for other books by this author.If you're interested in something a good deal longer that delves into suspense and a bit of science-fiction, here's another one I enjoyed.The Haunting of the Rose Queen",1
297,5,"I gotta tell you that I first heard about this series of books a few years back and was not at all interested and then I fell face first into ""the end of the world as we know it"" when I became a fan of Glenn Beck and took off my blinders and really saw what is happening to this country and to our so called civilized world. As a military veteran I have found this series to be a blast to read. The character development is such that you really get to know them and it hurts you when one of them is hurt or God forbid killed. The author makes it a point to let you know the good guy dosen't always win or live to see tomorrow. Do what I did and get the entire series and read them one right after the other. You won't be dissapointed that is until you run out of books to read. I can't wait until the next one. I love to read and this series does not dissapoint.  I have read all of the books in order and my only dissapontment is that there isn't another in my hands now.  Hurry up Ricky!!!",1

The relationship between Rocky and Layne in this book is intense from the beginning, and Layne's dedication to helping find out what caused Rocky to run from him years ago is captivating.  The other characters bring a lot to the story line as well - Layne's boys and their relationships with both Layne and Rocky are great, as well as Rocky's father's and brother's relationships with other characters in the story.  Definitely one of KA's must reads!",1

300,4,"Ok, I know this is a lot of propaganda.  It was written during WW-I by the Dept. of War.  In spite of this, the story is a good fairly well written story of a young army private in the British army during the early part of the war.  His story could have been written by a German or a Frenchman.  The privation and horror of that war make the US excursions into Iraq or Afghanistan seem mild.  The losses in KIA and MIA in one battle exceed our losses in both wars in total.That is not to demean the quality of the current US military, there is none better.  That is why our losses are relatively low today.This reader as a former Marine admires the intestinal fortitude of the young men that fought in that miserable GD war.  Their stories need to not be forgotten.I just wish this book were written in more contemporary English.",1

303,5,"I've only recently been introduced to Susanna Fraser's writing and I'm happy to have found her books.  I agree that she writes about similar happenings that you might find in Carly Kelly's books but I don't agree that she has a similar writing style.  Carla Kelly is one of my favorite authors but Susanna definitely has her own unique style and I for one appreciate both of these authors' ability to write about interesting characters whose lives do not fit anyone's preconceived notion of how a romance in the 1800's must be in order for the H/h to have their HEA.In The Sergeant's Lady, Anna Arrington has been accompanying her cavalry officer husband on his tours of duty in Wellington's army for two years.  Although she thought herself in love with him at the time of their marriage, she has lived to regret her choice many times over.  When he dies, she joins a convoy of wounded men and some other ladies who are traveling back to England and from there she plans to travel to her family home in Scotland.Accompanying this convoy is the handsome, capable, Sergeant Will Atkins who has befriended Anna previously and protected her from her husband at the risk of being flogged.  To say they are attracted to one another is an understatement.  They are in the midst of a war, he is an alpha male who is kind, responsible and honorable.  She is lovely, has suffered loneliness and the man who has shown her kindness is conveniently at hand.  She also happens to be the daughter of an earl and a very wealthy heiress whereas Will's family are not gentry - they own an inn and he is an enlisted man, having served in Wellington's army for 8 years. His older brother will inherit the family inn and Will's future profession will most likely be that of a simple farmer.But during wartime, things that may not be ""meant to be"" happen nonetheless and such is the pathway of Anna and Will.  When they become separated from their convoy because of circumstances which I won't reveal, they are thrown together for a few days without any chaperones and of course their relationship becomes deeper than they intended.  Actually, Anna is so hungry for the type of companionship denied her by his husband, she is willing to throw it all to the winds.  Will tries to be the gentleman he knows he should be... well, you get it.The big question:  How will Ms. Fraser give them their HEA?  Yes, it does take some time and a few readers may not enjoy some of the frustrations and circumstances that Will and Anna must go through. I thought this story was a refreshing change from so many books in this genre.  I plan to read all her books and look forward to future writings.",1

305,4,Like the shifter books. I do like the paranormal books that Jennifer Ashley writes. This is a very good read.,1
306,4,"I liked this story, a story of two individuals who waited until adulthood to realize that they where more alike then they thought.  I liked how it took Will's sister to say out loud what Will himself didn't want to admit, and it took Ethan leaveing (not because he wanted to, but beacuse of work) for Will to wake up and become the man he should be.  And I liked how when Ethan cames back three years later he's the one who is vulnerable & Will is the strong one.  These two men fit together, I think my favorate part in this story are Will's parents who are so loving and supportive & axcepting of him, the absolute shock for Will when he found out they already knew about him and that they knew how much he was in love with Ethan & vise-versa was priceless.  Great Story",1
307,5,"This book fell into our laps at a time when my husband had been blindsided by a chronic illness that ended his long-term career in commercial driving. It was scary enough contemplating such a change at 45 years old, then, before the ink had dried on his updated resume, he was diagnosed with cancer. The treatment has been long and hard, but it's nearing its end. While my husband can look forward to a full recovery, he now has to face his interrupted job search at a point when his stamina is iffy and his self-confidence bruised. Paul Rega's book offers a clear, user-friendly approach to looking for work in tough economic times and difficult personal circumstances. So much of who we are is wrapped up in what we do for a living. Perhaps the most difficult part of unemployment is how it can strip away our identity. This book doesn't just address the mechanics of a job search. Common sense tells a job hunter to target specific companies, clean up his resume, show up to the interview on time, etc. What is more difficult is generating the gumption to put yourself out there, to take a risk when all you want to do is hide in a corner. Through his professional advice and personal stories, Paul Rega looks at the reader as a whole person with needs, desires and fears that can't help but impact his or her job search. This book offers a way to orient oneself, a way to begin. And beginning is two-thirds of the battle.Note on the reviewer: I obtained Paul Rega's book free as a promotional download on a social networking site. The offer showed up a week or so after my husband had to leave his job, but the cancer diagnosis that followed caused many months to pass before we actually read the book. While I am a writer and an editor, I do not ""trade"" reviews, and I do not review books that I have not read. My opinions--good or bad--are my own.",1

When the portal closes, Vana knows there is no escape; she is stranded like all of the other women. She is in no mood to be a meek, obedient hostage, regardless of how well they are treated.Dagon didn't mean for the women to become a part of the war between him and his enemies; they aren't about to let the Beasts casually enjoy their new women. They have their own spies in the Beasts' stronghold, and are making plans.Witness the relationship that grows between two very different, but strong people. She is no wilting flower, and gives as good as she gets. Against his will, Dagon is unbearably attracted to this spectacular specimen of womanhood. Striking sparks off each other, before long, neither will be able to deny what they feel for each other.The science fiction elements are fascinating, and bring a different kind of element to this love story. I enjoyed the author's worldbuilding, and how she didn't overwhelm the reader with too much detail--just enough to be quite interesting. I love the Darklands books, and cannot wait to read the rest! Highly recommended!",1
310,4,"I rarely write reviews since I feel like I have nothing more to say other than plagiarizing someone else's raves or criticisms.  I really did not want to read this book even though I am currently addicted to Kristen Ashley books. The plot point of almost 20 years before they meet again just was too frustrating, Like the worst t.v. show couple shipping. Who wants to get into that from the beginning? Luckily someone else wrote that some of the characters from ""At peace"" appear and as that is one of my favorites so I decided to buy the book and just read those parts. The book was too good too much going on and I had to read the whole thing and am I glad. Still a frustrating situation but that is Ms. Ashley for you.",1
311,4,"Reunion:Heaton is one of my must read authors. I really enjoy her work, and I love this series, Vampires Realm, of books. However, this was not my favorite. It's worth the read, it just wouldn't be my first pick. I would still recommend the book though to anyone looking for a good vamp read that doesn't follow the same tired theme of the majority of vampire books these days.Marise is a vampire, a Law Keeper for her bloodline, the Venia bloodline. She also hasn't been home in 50 years due to her love at the time having cheated on her with his maker, but now she's been called home to investigate the attack on her Lord of the bloodline. Her former lover, Jascha, is there and is the head guard for the Lord. When her Lord was attacked, two guards were killed and one was gravely wounded. That guard, of course, was Jascha. As a Law Keeper, Marise is not supposed to show emotion, but that becomes increasingly harder as she sees Jascha's injuries and tends to him and spends time with him during her investigation.The writing is well done. The character growth is good. However, I wasn't as found of this female character as I have been with other female characters of Heaton's. I like that she's a strong, independent female that can take care of herself rather than the overdone damsel in distress. But, she just had personality flaws that annoyed me like she's supposed to have had a relationship with this man, but lied to him the entire time and upon the falling out incident still didn't come clean. I just had a hard time swallowing that. Her lack of interest in learning to speak even basic Russian sort of bugged me too. It seemed to make her sound bubbly, which she is not presented to be. I also found a bit of confusion in the genetically altered human vampire slayer villain character. There seemed to be something missing with this part of the story line.However, overall, I did enjoy the book, and was left wanting to read more of this series. Like I said, if you're looking for a fairly short, but not too short vampire romance with a twist, then give this one a try. It's not your typical vampire romance story where the vamps are lonely heroes who are just misunderstood by the world or that overplayed damsel in distress saved by the oh so mysterious man. It's darker with the vamps not being all wonderful heroes and heroines but not being all bad either. They're more relatable than many vamps of other books I think. It's a fast, fun read that kept me interested to the end.",1

315,5,"I had a great time diving back into the wonderful world created by J.C. Andrijeski.`The Shield', the second book in the series, has lived up to the standard of the first book. As gripping, as action-packed, as full with tension this time the story peeks, taking the reader onto a different level.The powers Allie and Revik are facing much stronger this time, more powerful, more unrestrained than ever.Their love story is beautiful, marvelously tense and heartbreaking.The twist in the end is breathtaking and unexpected.J.C. Andrijeski has a wonderful way with words. Her descriptions are so extremely vivid. You can feel the surroundings, roaming either through the wonderful valleys of Himalayas or the concrete hair-raising underground constructions. With all the descriptiveness, you find yourself hanging on every word, afraid to miss something, drain with tension and fear.I'm looking forward to reading the third book in the series.",1

317,5,"I bought this for my android cellphone/kindle. It is a fantastic story and kept my attention the entire time and I couldn't put my phone/kindle down.Others are telling you the plot so I won't repeat it. What I will say is that the author had an amazing imagination when he wrote this story.He places an American into a character that was not yet in existence (in the story) but was already part of our known history. Extremely clever idea and unexpected by me.I cringed during part of the scenes because some of it was harsh, but the story still held my interest. I wanted more and did not want the story to end. I would have liked to see what happened to Diane when she returned to ""our"" time and had to explain where she and her boyfriend were. Very interesting story. I will read it again in a few weeks because there was so much going on that I want to absorb it again.",1

319,4,"I didn't think I'd like this western/sci-fi concept but, alas, it was fun to tag along for the ride. It was well-written and kept my imagination running full-speed. The tale worked well as a very ""short-story"" offering. As a Western fan, I recommend it.",1
320,4,"Quick read, was able to finish the book in just two days.  The only thing that was confusing in the text was the pictures missing but the captions were available for reading.",1
321,5,If there really is a God please let me volunteer to be kidnapped by someone as wonderful(and hot) as Chay Amory LOL.This book was a terrific read and I really enjoyed getting to know Kasie and Chay.I loved the story too and will be back for  more for sure.I don't read many romances that give the characters alot of depth so this was a pleasant surprise.I highly reccomend it for a nonstop page turning session with my whole heart. Enjoy!,1

324,4,"I enjoy Debora's Nibbles!  They are interesting, witty, short and so much fun.  She never fails to draw me into the story and I simply love the characters she develops.  I hope she writes some more with Jake and Romy and their mission to help young witches.  Debora has such a vivid imagination; I can't wait for the next Nibble!  I would recommend this to everybody who needs a little escapism.",1

Brittany has a past that holds her back from anything more than meaningless flings.  Charlie wants to see past Brittany's appearance but she's holding back.After winning the lottery Brittany and he two best friends hire Charles to help manage their winnings.  After going on a few shopping sprees, Brittany has decided to take a chance and do something good with her money.  Charlie is thrilled until she starts asking questions about his sex life.  After a hot meeting in his office, neither of them can stop thinking about the other.  Will Brittany be able to let go and let Charlie love her or will she walk away from what could be true love?This is the first in a three book series and I love it.  We get to meet Brittany and her two best friends after they won the lottery.  They have hired Charlie to help but soon Charlie and Brittany have a passionate interlude that leaves them both wanting more.  This story is hot, hot, hot!  Be warned (personally it's a good warning if you're like me) this is erotica and there is lots of hot, well described sex in this book.  But the most important thing is that there is romance and a good plot as well.  I love the switch between POV.  I always enjoy knowing what both characters are thinking.  There is a HEA here so you don't have to worry about that.  Lol  You might as well buy books two and three when you get this one because you are definitely going to want to read those immediately after finishing this one.",1
326,5,I like the book i was surprised by the outcome. With the Alpha being gay. but i liked the ending. it just shows that everyone just wants to be loved.,1
327,4,"I was a little taken back by this book as it is definitely more than a nod to the movie ""Indecent Proposal."" Same plot as the movie a young couple madly in love go to Vegas hoping to strike it rich only to have that dream dashed and end up with nothing but their love for each other. For Daisy that just isn't enough and after breaking down all of her wants and desires to her fianc&eacute; Pete, it isn't enough for him either. This is where Zillionaire Aiden walks in. He's rich, good-looking, single, bored and looking for a new game to play in a town he's already conquered. Daisy and Pete are just ripe for the picking with their bright eyes straight out of the dim country into the blinding lights of Sin City. Aiden takes advantage of the situation to form a contract where he gets one night (ONE HOT NIGHT) with Daisy for a million dollars. After some rather causal thought, the lovebirds decide to take the Zillionaire up on his offer.Fast forward to 24 hours later and all the regrets, shame, disappointment and in the case of Aiden - attraction rears up before the players like a second ace on a blackjack table. What's left of the story deals with knowing when to hold em and knowing when to fold em, knowing when to walk away and when to run. Daisy never counted the money when sitting at the table there'll be time enough for counting when the dealings done.The story could benefit from a close edit due to the many misplaced words and misspelled words. Not entirely bothersome, but could have been better.I wouldn't call this story a romantic one as it deals more with consequences than romance. It's at times heartbreaking and will make you really hate all the characters to some degree at different parts of the story. But by the end some if not all will have made it back into your favor - you be the judge.I would recommend this book based in part because it is a good although unoriginal read, but mostly for its follow-up ""Daisy's Choice"" which is a wonderful read, but best understood from reading this one first.",1
328,5,"Highly recommend to anyone who likes romantic suspense.  The author really captures you from the first page.  The moment the gunshot shattered the peaceful scene by the pond, I knew this was a winner.  I fell in love with her characters right off. Great development and chemistry between Sara and Dan with lots of emotional twists. Very believable and fun banter between the two as they try to deny their true feelings.  A gripping story with an equal balance of suspense and romance.  Can't wait to read more by Cheri Jetton.",1
329,5,"SO MUCH LOVE. I can already tell this will go on next year's top ten.I don't really read nonfiction, and I usually hate writing advice compendiums. Hate with the fiery passion of a Spanish Inquisitor. But I didn't expect plain language, tons of cursing, bite-sized chunks of knowledge, wit, and solid advice to be the cure for that. Well, on reflection, I shouldn't have been surprised, because I love those things. Anyway, Wendig really knows what he's doing, and he has a personable style that delivers just enough of a kick in the pants and warm encouragement to really be useful. I have to mention that he is a bit cursory on grammatical and compositional details, so you might need a different book for precise help with sentences, but that's not really the purpose of the book anyway.I am pretty sure this book has changed my life and outlook on writing; it certainly has done so on editing my own work. As a professional editor and author, I am recommending this book to everyone i know who writes, has questions about writing, is aspiring to be a writer, or who just needs a laugh.Still in doubt? Read the one-stars. If you're not convinced this book is sinfully readable and awesome, the uptight overreactions will convert you.",1
330,5,"Ever wonder what a world without badness would look like? Or how it would feel to live in a perfect environment? The Overtaking takes you to a place where goodness reigns and bad thoughts can simply be erased. People are transplanted from a harmful society to a manufactured city without crime and worries.Danielle believed the premise. She thought she was kidnapping Shayne for his own good, taking him out of an evil environment and giving him paradise. But Shayne's memory wipe does not go as planned, and he retains his mind-reading abilities. Memories of a mother he was programmed to forget pop up, and he starts to realize that things are not as they seem. As Danielle's eyes are open, she and Shayne fall in love and discover a nefarious plot built on an illusion.The story is fast paced and fresh--cute and heart-pounding and joyous and gut-wrenching all at the same time. This book was a great start to what will be an epic and exciting series. The cast of characters includes many talents and special abilities as well as two members from the overlord group. Shayne is a cutie-pie, Danielle is gutsy, and Jennaya upbeat and friendly. My only complaint is that one of the heart-throbs died. He had so much potential! (sob, sob, sob).Summary: Delightful sci-fi romance and great start to an engaging series. Victorine Lieske has gathered a personable cast of characters, Shayne, Danielle, Nolan, Celeste, Jennaya, Kellec, Asia, and Gita to fight an evil empire bent on mind controlling a peaceful planet and raiding it for their resources. I can't wait to read the next installment.",1
331,4,"A 3.5 final rating for W.V.. I had this one on my to-read list but it wans't on my immediate reads. What changed? 1) Blacky seemed to like this one and made it seem hot. 2) The synopsis also made the book hot and very appeling. 3) There is a warning in the begining of the book Reader Advisory: Although all sex acts are 100-percent consensual, Willing Victim contains role-playing scenarios that may upset some readers who are sensitive about rape, even in a simulated capacity. . How could I resist that? In theory the book would be on my I-love-them list. But in this cold reality is not. I liked it enough to say with cofidence that I did but not enough to suggest it to a friend.A scene in the early parts of the book had my stomach turning in a bad way and me losing some of the positive feelings for the book. Also I am not sure if the book was hot or the summer heat that made me think that the book was hot.",1

334,5,"I found ""The Cahokian"" to be a great read!  This book opened cultures I've rarely visited in fiction or non-fiction reading, exposing a brutal clash of people sparing the reader few details. The prose-driven story is big on detail and small on animation, and to me a reasonable variation in which to create an adventure novel with historic backdrops.  I found the book fascinating from the first page and recommend it highly to readers that favor a treat from mainstream templates, paranormal romance, or dark fantasy stories.  This fast-reading piece is interesting and enjoyable. Excellent work, five stars!",1
335,4,"Veiled Desire is the first book I've read by Alisha Rai.  It's a charming and romantic story of a slightly older woman, (only by 4 years) who finds herself attracted to her younger brother's best friend Mason.  Mason lives in the house behind Leyla's and has been carrying a torch for her for quite some time.  They have a long history together having grown up very close and now he feels the time is right for seduction.Leyla has been a sort of mother figure to Mason and her younger brother due to circumstances of their childhood.  But now she finds herself romantically attracted to Mason, seeing him as a sexy man rather than a kid, and her feelings are conflicted.  Leyla is hesitant to give in to her attraction to Mason, however she is finding it more and more difficult to resist when she discovers she has a very nice view into his house.  Leyla is a conservative girl on the outside with a secret naughty nature just waiting for the right man to bring it out.Mason is the kind of neighbor every single girl would dream of having.  He's a sexy doctor who knows how to cook and isn't afraid to strut around the house in his whitey tighties.  He's a bit of a tease, but has every intention of following through on his seduction of Leyla.  While relatively confident he'll win Leyla's heart, the only thing that could stand in the way is Sasha, his best friend and who also happens to be Leyla's overprotective younger brother.  (Sasha is the hero in the next book in the series Veiled Seduction.)I very much enjoyed this romantic novella. It's a straight forward love story of two people who's friendship blossoms into romance.  Alisha Rai infuses her characters with her witty sense of humor and creates characters that are lovable and realistic, with sexy chemistry that will steam up your e-reader.  If you're in the mood for a quick, nicely paced, sexy romance, then you'll want to check out Alisha Rai's Veiled Desire.",1

338,5,"Ok, I know it sounds too good to be true, and it's not like you're going to lose 20 lbs in a day, BUT it is something you can do for one day and give yourself a kickstart. I tried doing the 1 Day Diet sometime last year and I have to say it wasn't easy the first time I did it. I did get a bit lightheaded and had a hard time controlling my impulses which were telling me I was starving...which of course I was not. However, I did lose 3lbs. I figured it was water, and the next day I had put back on 2lbs. But still, overall, that meant I lost 1lb in a day. I would do the 1 Day Diet twice a week and lost between 2-3 lbs in a week. I don't necessarily continue with this every week but it is a great thing to go back to when you find you have been splurging every once in awhile.",1

343,5,"You do not often find a story that is novella length, introducing a world for the first time that completely fleshes out the characters and the plotline so well as Silent Blade manages.  The reader manages to sympathize with the hero even though what he did to the heroine as a young man was selfish.  You understand that they are products of their society.  The manner that both come to understand each other and fall in love just fits.The fact that the authors did not try to make an easy & pat resolution for the couple speaks well of their talent for weaving a realistic and satisfying story.  I truly enjoyed the world-building and the storyline.  The characters were well developed and the reader is actually happy for the hero and heroine in the end.",1

347,4,"I bought this second Dix Dodd mystery after reading the first one- The Case of the Flashing Fashion Queen.  Other reviewers of this and the other book have compared them to Evanovich.  These books so far aren't quite up to that laugh out loud cleverness (I'm talking early Evanovich, not the last few) but are still fun reads.  Hopefully this series will continue and evolve-it's has the potential to become better than the Stephanie Plum series because the characters have more grittiness and dimension than the one note joke Evanovich characters.Dix is a P.I. who has started her own firm after figuring out that she can't ever become more than a gofer in a traditional firm in the male dominated private investigator business. She's determined to succeed and relies mostly on her amazing intuition, along with her disguise ability and just plain inability to stop until it's done.  I fell in love with the supporting characters, they're a hoot.  We have the brilliant hunky assistant, who has a backstory of his own, and Mrs. Presley, the owner of a skuzzy, rent by the hour motel who wears blue suede shoes and has a heart of gold, as long as you don't cross her. Then we have the Mrs. Presley's sons-two behemoths who still need their mama, and Dix's mom, an outrageous woman with a story of her own (she was a magician's assistant for years before she married and claims she learned to do real magic.)I liked the first book better.  Which you should read before this one anyway.  The first was a murder mystery which had more twists and turns and action than this one about stolen jewelry.  Or it could just be me OD'ing, I bought this one and read it immediately after reading Flashing Fashion because I wanted more!  Or maybe it's because there's just not going to be as much action in a story set in a retirement village...In any event, N.L. Wilson has made it to my favorite author list and I look forward to the next Dix Dodd mystery.",1

Lemme see, she's a crack shot at the firing range, and she's whip smart, and as a wife and mother, she's a whiz at multi-tasking! What mother isn't, right?I see some reviewers couldn't get past the idea that one dispense with reality. Really? We do that every time an author asks us to climb into their book. And how realistic is it to expect to find a housewife with a secret job as a CIA assassin? Can you think of all the books that ask the reader to believe that a man can pull it off, so why not a woman? That said, this is not just a fun read, it's also a really good mystery.

358,5,"Number 5 of the Civil War Brides Series:Like the first four, this book contains time travel, history, mystery, romance and some modern humor.  I loved the first book in the series, I think this is my second favorite, although they are all great reads.  Victoria is one of many before her who has been thrown into the middle of the civil war battle from the modern day Chicago where she was working on her photography and dodging the FBI who are trying to find out where these people keep disappearing to.  They want to protect Victoria, she just wants to be left alone.Once she has been thrown into the Civil War era of 1864, she finds out where the people before her have been transported to, and by the time she finds out how and why she ended up thrown into the past, she is told that she can return, will she return?  She has a man who is constantly lurking in background, creeping her out with his constant strange comments.  Obviously a mad man, he does kidnap her, you'll have to read the book to see how that turns out.Tracey Jane Jackson, author of the Civil War Brides Series, is quite the Civil War buff. She weaves history into her books, much history many of us may have learned and forgotten while in school.  While reading the time travel series you will find yourself learning again about the war between the states.  It is told in such a way that you learn the history this author has in her head and heart as she loves this time period, while enjoying great stories much of which were true.  Of course the time travel is not, but that is that the great thing about fiction, you can weave stories around true events, and throw in all the extras that make a good story.  This author does just that!If you haven't read the previous four I suggest you do so, you'll find out what you've missed, they are all great reads!  Don't miss out on this number five or the following books. Tracey has 3 more books up her sleeve!I give this one five stars!Here is the description from the back of the book:Victoria Carrington is a small town southern debutante who is accepted into college in Chicago. Her roommate goes missing, and Victoria's family is convinced she is in danger.  Alone and somewhat irritated by the FBI's forced protection, she throws herself into her passion, photography.Her photography studio is housed in an historic building. While she is there one afternoon, she is led to a room that does not appear to have been touched in 100 years. She finds an old hand tinted Ambrotype of a soldier buried in a stack of paintings. As she is staring at his face, her world begins to spin.Quincy Butler is trapped in a hell he could never have imagined. Fighting yet another battle in The War Between the States, he is shocked to encounter a woman on the field. When she begins to speak to him, he realizes she is southern, and assumes she is the enemy.His intention to apprehend and take her to his superiors is cut short however, when he is shot and wounded.As Victoria tends to Quincy's injuries, will she be able to convince him to trust her?When she is kidnapped by a mad man, will Quincy save her before she is lost to him forever?",1

Talented author, Mary Manners, has a delightful way with words as she writes this captivating story which is sure to please the young at heart. It is full of love, broken hearts, and most importantly, hope...the hope of recapturing a love lost due to a very unfortunate set of circumstances.Logan Daniels returns to Mountain Ridge after four years. All those years ago...just weeks before his upcoming marriage to Kate, he moves to California to fulfill his dreams. He leaves Kate to face the challenges that come with the death of her parents and working side by side in a bakeshop with her sisters to keep her family together. Any reader who is interested in this genre is sure to enjoy this lovely interlude into what can happen when love wins. This novella is definitely a ""sweet treat""!Inspirational Author & Book Reviewer ~ Dolores Ayotte",1

362,4,"I've gone through too many booklights for my Kindle to count.. after researching lights thoroughly, I came upon the Verso Clip-On light. While I was extremely satisfied with it at first for its luminosity and clip strength (because we all know you flip-flop from side to side while reading at night!), I was underwhelmed with the battery longevity. Although easily fixable.. it's still kind of frustrating! After a week or so of heavy usage, I needed to replace the battery. I'd recommend it to friends, but warn them to buy an economy pack of replacement batteries, first!",1
363,4,"I really liked the book, funny, sexy and the series is fun loving.  I like when the girl goes after the guy.  There were a few grammar issues which seems to be the case in all Erin's books, but nothing major. I am not sure if the person who decided on the cover read the book, Mac is bald and Sarah is supposed to be tiny in the story, not the case with the models on the cover.  It is just a little thing, but still it is a detail that I would think the publisher would catch.",1
364,4,"Let me begin by saying that I enjoyed this book. Not necessarily what I was expecting though. The beginning had me turning the pages furiously to see what happened next, but the farther into the book I got the slower my page turns became. The book picked up again towards the end but I felt a slight lull in the middle. The story line is unique, addicting and a story I would pass on to my friends.",1
365,5,"I will try to explain as much as I can without revealing anything, there may be spoilers, you are forewarned.PlotI would say there is a solid plot. In simple speak, the good guy starts weak and gathers strength. The kingdom of Dremlock and the world are under threat of being conquered by ""evil"". The unique ability the main character has is key in fighting back this evil.Character Development-The Divine Knights are what you would expect of hardened veterans each having unique abilities. Their personalities are solid and remain true throughout the book.-The main character is not your typical hero, and at times his character flaws give cause for wanting a little more, however the writer does show progress in his development giving hope for the sequel. Sadly he is not the character most would be drawn to. The example of this is Taris, a much more interesting character.-The supporting characters are really well done up, the female is a little typical of fantasy fiction support as the attractive mage.-The warrior's character was the biggest failing in the developing of the story. At random times his alignment goes from chaotic good to neutral with no good cause. He is also considered the intelligent one but his actions are completely contradictory.-The thief character is one that I think original, mysterious and one that draws more interest than the majority of the other characters in the story.EnviromentGloomy. There is a pervailing heaviness that is constantly impressed through numerous direct and indirect influences. Such as landscape, architecture, emotional and physical presence. The shadow reached out of the book to inflict its gloom as I read, I mean that as a praise to the authors writing.Grammar and SpellingFor an E-book I only found a handful of mistakes, such as bit was spelled ""bi"" and singing was ""signing"". Other than that I was pleased that I could read and not get caught up on little things such as that.I didn't find any speach grammar issues through dialogue, which made it easier to follow.As far as punctuation and formating his skills surpass mine as a writer. (kudos)OriginalityWell constructed with subtle personal touches. Plot is standard. Characters are rich but main character may have been overdone in the negative light but great job breaking from the almighty hero. The world is not laid out for the lack luster imagination; the author clearly wants to express character interactions and empahisizes alot on back history in present tense.Pros-Great characters-Story moves at a the right pace-Plenty of actionCons-The warrior support friend-The use of GOBLIN this GOBLIN that. (Obvious the factor that ties every evil thing in this story together is... orcs... NO! G O B L I N -_- )I really enjoyed this book. I will read this series through to the end based soley off this first one. As an avid fantasy fiction reader and writer I highly recommend this for a good read.If my summary left something out or you have anything you'd like to discuss or just get my recommendations on other fantasy fiction books, please feel free to leave a comment. =) Happy reading!",1
366,4,"I am glad that I didn't listen to the negative reviews. This was a cute, quick read and I found the characters to be 2 clueless men who had way more book sense then common sense. As I have a step-son like that I found the characters totally believable because I look at my son sometimes and wonder WTH his thought process was.If you have read the other books in the series, please don't skip this one too. You will enjoy it as well as you enjoyed the other ones. I think sometimes we tend to over analzye things and it's just not that serious.I enjoyed it and I am looking forward to reading Adam and Morgan's story too. Hope they are next because Benny needs a dad or two!",1
367,5,"The Silk Trilogy should be read in order, if you read this book first you won't get the references to people from previous books.Ian Cameron is returning to India, after being rescued from captivity in Bokhara he is finally going back to his fiance Georgina, she was his lode star the entire time he was imprisoned. But the British government had declared that Ian was dead, he's been gone for two years and time marches on. Georgina has married another man and is shocked to see Ian. Devastated Ian, leaves Georgina and fortunately discovers his brother is now stationed in Cambay Station. David brings him to his home and tells him that he should return home as he has inherited the title of Laird of Falkirk due to the deaths of his uncle and his uncle's two sons; Ian decides to resign his commission and return to Scotland.Ian has one promise to take care of before he can leave India, his cell mate a Russian officer, Colonel Pyotr Andreyovich, had kept a diary in the margins and blank pages of his bible, he asked Ian to delver it to his only living relative, Larissa Alexandrovna, Pyotr called her his Little Lara. Lara lived in India with her stepfather, as her mother had passed away and there was no other family, their last known address was in Baipur and that wasn't far from Cambay Station after he delivered the bible he would return and visit his brother before leaving for Scotland.Lara who now called herself Laura Stephenson and her stepfather are on a tour of his district when Ian arrives in Baipur but he is given the schedule for Kenneth Stephenson and leaves immediately in order to catch up with them. When he does its to discover that Kenneth Stephenson has passed away and Laura is alone and will need help to return to Baipur.Ian is a handsome, jubilant young man who loved his position in the army, the man who returned to India was a different person, he felt he was a failure and didn't want to deal with people or talk with anyone. He was so alone and didn't know how to make his way back to a life that he loved. Laura had her own share of misery, her father died when she was nine, she had never forgotten how her parents passion destroyed their marriage. Laura was afraid of passion, she was determined that she would not end up being ruled by her passion as a Russian - she wouldn't marry anyone, she would rather be alone than be the object of some man's passion.Wonderful story!  Ian and Laura were broken souls how needed to learn how to live their lives in spite of their past history. You see them grow and change during this novel, I loved the action and romance and the foreign locale, this is truly and outstanding trilogy. Ms Putney surpassed herself!",1
368,4,"As many of you already know Jennifer has already positively reviewed K.C. Blake's Crushed on the blog site A Tale of Many Reviews and I have to say I am in total agreement with my colleagues assessment of this young adult novel.  I found Crushed to be a smooth read with interesting characters and a fun and slightly devious plot.  The Noah sisters are witches and every year they compete with one another in a test of their witchy powers.  Crushed follows the sister's latest competition which proves to be quite different than in years past.  All three of the sisters are challenged in ways they never could have foreseen: personally, romantically, scholastically, and paranormally.  Blake does an excellent job of fully developing each of the girls' personalities.  They are individuals each with their own strengths and weakness and this is something that will be appealing to a wide range of readers.  Blake's writing style is smooth, quick, and absolutely age appropriate.  If you're looking for a new witch series I would certainly recommend giving K.C. Blake's Crushed a try as it is a fun start to what seems to be a very promising series.",1
369,4,"It is a good story. Steel seemed a lot more like a Cyborg to me than Flint did, but I liked that he was so logical. Rena was a very likeable heroin. Mrandmrsroc characters better than Mira. I'm on to the next story. Happy reading",1
370,5,Wow what an awesome first book. I have all and was going to wait and do the reviews all together.I love reading about guns and hard bodies and special ops type guys. Who wouldn't?When you get a great story line great action and some pretty steamy sex you have a book no one wants to put down till it's finished. That was me tonight. I can't stop thinking about it that's why the review.This book is awesome. I'm hoping the series is too.Luke and his team are sent to kill Peren. As it happens Luke isn't comfortable with the kill just yet. Turns out his team isn't the only 1 hired. Or the only person wanting to kill her. So he saves her. The action starts in the first chapter. It's practically nonstop from there. There's a great story building that I think runs through the whole series with different characters taking centre stage each book.Really well written and draws you in from the first page.,1
371,5,"""THE UNWILLING BRIDE"" BY CANDY ANN LITTLEI'm not usually one to get into romances, I like them but I have to be in a certain mood to read them and for some reason that time usually comes around Christmas or Thanksgiving through Christmas; but I have to say that this book was fantastic and I enjoyed every moment of it. The main character of the story Caitlin is young, spry, and completely unconventional! She is determined to be her own woman in a time when women were looked upon as being nothing more than an ornament on a man's arm. I absolutely loved her! Then we have Dillon Cade, an Englishman living in America running his own printing press and one of the most eligible bachelors in the land. He is the quintessential perfect male and I had no trouble at all falling in love with him from the beginning, however, it takes Caitlin a lot longer!The fact this story was not just about romance but had profound elements of true history made it all the more endearing.Caitlin's parents thrust her into an arranged marriage to save her from being forced back to Ireland and into possible danger. When Dillon realizes just how hard it is on her he begins to put things into motion to help her get her parents back to America. Candy Ann Little writes like a pro for this genre, she has the ability to bring out the spark and life in characters and makes them so real you can't help but wish you knew them!It doesn't matter if you are not a huge fan of romance novels, this one you HAVE to pick up. It's not just a romance it's a lesson in history in such a way that you have no choice but to absorb it! I only wish they could have taught history this way back when I was in school, it would have made it so much more interesting!-Kitty Bullard / Great Minds Think Aloud Book Club",1
372,5,This was a wonderful book! I couldn't put it down. I think everyone will enjoy this book and I recommend it to everyone. One of Susan Mallery best!,1

374,4,To bad the North American Indian does not document their own traditions.  At least I get a view of something I know nothing about.

375,5,"Sebastian Wakefield isn't happy when his ex, Luke Emerson, shows up at his tattoo shop wanting a tattoo.  He's even less happy when he finds out what it is: an angel memorial tattoo for someone named ""A.J.""  He can't really afford to turn down the business, however, so he agrees to do the tat.Once he gets Luke in his tattoo chair, all his old feelings come rushing back.  He's still attracted to Luke, and he has a lot of deep feelings for the man aside from the bitterness and anger over Luke's cheating ways.  It's obvious Luke shares his attraction, and pretty soon Seb's wondering why they shouldn't sleep together again--just sex, no emotions involved.  That shouldn't be too hard...A.J.'s Angel is a great mix of emotional and hot.  I really sympathized with Sebastian.  Even years after Luke's betrayal, he's still hurt.  He just doesn't realize how much until Luke shows up wanting a tattoo.  He struggles with anger, jealousy over the mysterious ""A.J."", and an attraction he can't shake.  The ""I'll sleep with him to get him out of my system"" plot is not anything new, but it was well-done here.  Seb knows he's playing with fire, and accepts the potential consequences even as he gives in to his desires.Since Sebastian is the first-person narrator, Luke is less developed.  He really messed up the first time they were together, something he freely admits.  Most of the time I absolutely hate cheaters in books, but it's clear that Luke understands how badly he hurt Seb and that he wants to make amends.  The scenes between Luke and Sebastian are both hot and emotional.  Sebastian goes through an emotional wringer in A.J.'s Angel, and thanks to his narration the reader gets to come along.  There's not a lot of external action to be found here, but the emotional journey kept me interested enough that I didn't care.  L.A. Witt is fast becoming one of my auto-buy authors, and A.J.'s Angel does not disappoint.  Contemporary fans, pick this one up!CassieReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1
376,5,"I absolutely loved thisbook.  The characters were real, the story believable.  Without any spoilers it's hard to get into the reasons I loved it so much, other than to say Grace was a very strong, selfless, caring and beautiful woman and Trick, although he was an ass for most of the book, I couldn't help but feel his pain.  The story had major twists and turns and suspense that goes to the last page.  The sex was niiiice and steamy, just the way I like it...Will look for more books from this author immediately.",1

But a funny thing happens, he witnesses two other death row inmates being taken away and returned. That never happened in the past. You either stayed on death row or left and never returned...if you know what I mean.Before his actual time comes up, he too is removed. Not one to be a spoiler, I will allow you, the reader, to experience his tale firsthand. I know you'll feel his pain as he gets roughed up a bit...and doesn't understand why. But in the end it all comes to him...as it will to you.Kevin Hopson spins a tale of action, suspense and anticipation into this work of short fiction.

379,5,"It is something that you have a very hard time of putting down. It has all of the elements that I look for in a book, romance, paranormal, and action. I read this book in one setting.When I purchased this book I had no clue what it was about, I liked the cover and I needed something to read so I purchased it for .99 cents.Boy am I glad that I did. This novel introduces us to the Erris Coven and the first couple in the series, Lexie and Torin. Ms. Wheeler does a very good job of getting you to take an interest in Lexie and Torin's world. Her writing pulls you in and you are soon caring about what happens to each character in the book. Pretty soon you are telling yourself that there had better be stories about the supporting characters in the story or you are going to go postal. Then you tell the little voice in your head that (yes I do answer back), this is a five book series so you get to see if they (the supporting cast) get their happily ever after (HEA).All in all a very good YA paranormal romance book that will keep you engrossed on a comfy morning or a lazy afternoon.",1
380,4,"In this intro to the world of Celestial beings, we are drawn to the love affair between Logan and Skyla and the character development between these two is palpable. The availability to speak without vocal cords is a nice touch however, unlike your average telepathy ability, this one doesn't seem to be used as a means to avoid an enemy, but rather a simple ability that is just plain accepted. That, I like. The adrenaline rush the characters feel is just as much a heart pumper for the reader on this adventure.This book has earned four hearts! I'm quite happy with the turnout for the plot of this story. I slightly wonder about the new arrangement that you find at the very end and what drama will ensue from making such a decision when there is a known variable that could really make a difference. The reason this didn't earn five hearts was simply because this is an original indie. Not that Indies are bad, but this one is brought down for grammar issues. Nothing that can't be pushed passed but the quantity did range rather high. This author now has an editor and a few beta readers who have picked through it several times so I'm sure that those have been addressed since I purchased this book.",1
381,5,"This is one of the few books I have read that did not lose my interest from the first page to the last.  That is rare for me. Most of the time the books I read lag in the middle to the point that I want to skip over parts, but this one did not have that problem. I have read a few of Dohner's other books, such as the first 2 books in the Zorn Warrior series, and they are also wonderful. I love her writing style and the Alpha Males. Hot hot hot and leaves me wanting more.",1
382,4,I enjoyed this book. Very imaginative and unique. The fairies are not the new cute and nice versions seen today they are what came from tales of long ago the author put them back to what they are tricksters. The main character is a classic nerdy boy that can't wait to get home and read. The story takes a turn for the worse at least for Phinnegan when he is thrust into a new world that is totally different from his world. It didn't matter to me but there was references to drinking and smoking but nothing that would keep me from reading it to a child. Overall a good read.,1
383,4,"Fair Game was quite good.  Lanyon is excellent at showing the relationship between two men, particularly when one is in law enforcement and the other isn't.  I loved the way Elliot and Tucker behaved with each other.  Their relationship ended on a poor note and, clearly, neither man had come to grips with it, so watching them both struggle with their feelings for each other (anger, lust, disappointment, etc.) was great to read.  The mystery didn't hold my interest as much as the relationship, but I liked that this book had some racial diversity in the secondary characters, something you don't see much in m/m books (or at least I don't).",1

That happiness comes about when he meets the gorgeous and kind Aaron, who seems to be his salvation.But Aaron may be hiding something that could end up destroying any chance for happiness Matt can find.I don't want to give too much away, suffice to say I've already reread the story many times and loved the path it took to resolve any issues or secrets between the characters.Can't wait to read more from this author.",1

386,4,"I must admit I am guilty of not reading many books outside of my two favorite genres -- fantasy and paranormal. I downloaded a copy of this a long time ago when it was free and it has been collecting cobwebs on my kindle ever since. Two days ago, I made the decision to give it a try. I have read a handful of books lately outside of my comfort zone and was very impressed. Now, I am kicking myself for not reading Stanton's book sooner.I read this book in less than two days, which means I loved it and could barely put it down. I am a bit shocked that I fell in love with the supporting characters instead of the main character, but that just made the book even better. The plot was believable, fast-paced, and full of action. The reviewer who stated the main character engaged in meaningless violence obviously has never thought how THEY would feel or react if they were in Cole's shoes. I loved WD and The Dogs of War and hope they will be in the second book. When one of the characters died, I felt an emptiness in my heart.Stanton must have put a lot of thought and research into this book. It is well-written and chock-full of twists that had me mumbling a few explicit words from time to time. The only problem I found was some head-hopping, but it was nothing that took away from my enjoyment of the novel. I am eagerly awaiting the second book!",1
387,4,"I would give this 4+ stars if it weren't for a few sexual interludes described in too much detail.  I liked the plot and even though I guessed the ending, it was a nice twist to the story.Violet and Iris are twin sisters that suffer a voilent event on their move out west.  Jacie grows up with parents who try to love her and each other, but fall short.  Their part in the story isn't the focus.  Most of the story takes place with Jacie finding true love and then trying to decide between true love and a nice man that loves her, but does  she love him?  Does she understand what true love is?  She learns and grows up during a trip to find her own roots.I don't want to give away the plot, but I did enjoy reading this book.  The points of views from the characters were well defined.  The story flowed mostly well.  I did find a few editing mistakes, but not enough to have it be an issue.Over all, if you like strong, handsome, romantic heros, or the western historical romance theme, I recommend this book.",1

The only complaints I have are that the ending really left me hanging and that it was slightly hard to follow the switching perspectives.

It can pull at you and pull at you until you are sure you are doing the right thing and though you may not regret events after that fork you may also still regret the way you took.

397,4,"For centuries, the Prime have been battling their brutal enemies, the Antareans.  Facing extinction as they struggle against escalating Antarean attacks, the proud warrior race begins the process of uniting with the Galactic Alliance to ensure their future.Captain Wulf Caradoc, as the heir of the Prime leader, is expected to assist with negotiations on behalf of his people.  The secret, secondary part of his agenda is to look for his gemate, the genetically ideal mate that will be bonded to him mentally, physically and emotionally until the end of his days.  The ambassadorial team he is assigned to escort is attacked by space pirates hired by Prime malcontents.  Despite their skillful defense tactics, Wulf, his crew, and their charges are in danger until Alliance forces can reach them.Captain Melina Dmitros is a top-notch Galactic Alliance officer who's paid her dues.  After receiving a distress message from the Prime ambassador party, she steps in to aid them.  When she finally meets the future Prime leader face-to-face, she is ambushed by the biological force of the Prime mating urge.  She is his gemate, his fated match and a Lost One.  Her body will not allow her to survive without him, regardless of how she feels.  Wulf is willing to do whatever it takes to claim and protect his mate so that they may persevere against their enemies.The action kicks up a dust storm in chapter one of Prime Obsession that never settles!  I was convinced that Captain Dmitros was a first-rate adrenaline junkie from all the non-stop battles.  I rarely encounter a novel with multiple action scenes per interval.  Melina takes on bad guys, dodges hits, sniffs out/repairs sabotages, and keeps time with her man.  It's all in a day's work for a woman that knows her way around the Prime as well as the Galactic Alliance.  Wulf is growls and nibbles when it comes to his mate, although he's more than earned his formidable Prime warrior and sex machine title.  However, Melina is always center stage and in the thick of it all.  I started to feel that she was beginning to upstage her man.  Ok, ok.  Admittedly, I do prefer strong, accomplished female antagonists.  Still, Melina proved a bit overwhelming at times.Wulf's growling seemed uh, well...ridiculous after a while.  I've read novels with alpha males expressing their protectiveness this way, yet the constant repetitiveness became excessive and silly after a while.  Of course, it was a relief to have Wulf take charge after watching Melina prove just how tough and skilled she is over and over again. I could better appreciate the developing relationship.  The author does an amazing job of revealing the awakening gifts from a gemat-gemate pairing. Once I got a grasp on the dynamic, it was okay for the plot to charge ahead.Prime Obsession is a fast-paced space opera outfitted in shiny new gadgets and modern characters.  If you're looking for a sci-fi novel brimming with loads of techno jargon, intergalactic intrigue and angst, you've come to the right place.  Melina and Wulf's chemistry decimates small planets.  The ""foreplay"" preceding their first time together behind closed doors covers way too much ground; it dangled on the storyline string a tad longer than I would have preferred.  The romance and dialogue occasionally feels dated, although I could appreciate some truly cute moments.  Monette Michaels' narrative style is clean and precise with crisp visuals that flow easily from scene to scene.  All in all, it's fun to be kept on the edge of your seat for the bulk of the ride.  That's no easy feat in a story with so many subplots and secondary characters.  If this is just the first installment, then the next episode will have to put in some major overtime to keep up.PatriceReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",1

He bursts into her kitchen only to find the lady sitting at her table in tears, after giving her a good talking down he leaves her house feeling like a louse.Max and Elizabeth both think of their disastrous meeting as just something that happens, and put it out of their minds until they once again meet up at the hospital where Elizabeth is seeking employment. This time the meeting is more subdued and both realize that they just might find something about the other that they like.

Luckily for Elizabeth, the other fallen woman of the neighborhood, Leslie Gibson, comes calling and offers friendship and a shoulder to cry on.Can life go on for this little rag tag group of misfits, or will they not be able to get over their own individual heartaches? Seasons will change and only time will tell.Ms. Forster is the master of storytelling. She writes in different genres, from legal thrillers and spine tingling mysteries, to women's romance, all of which have one thing in common, her ability to tell a good story filled with rich characters and thought provoking plots.In this story she tells us of one woman's struggle to become an independent person while continuing to be the mother she desires to be, and hopefully finding peace with a man who truly cares about her. Elizabeth is not a strong woman when we first meet her, as a matter of fact she is everything I personally don't like in a woman. She is totally bound to her husband and when he leaves her she can't cope. She doesn't know how to make a living, isn't sure how to handle her son, hasn't ever had a close friend and can't figure out how to deal with a good man. I have to say I didn't like her in the beginning, and even though she grew throughout the story, I still found her a bit of a selfish one dimensional person.Max, on the other hand, was a good man through and through. He took on Elizabeth, Christopher and his own problems all with the patience and love of a saint. I gave him more than a little bit of my heart.Christopher was a troubled child who needed a much firmer hand than Elizabeth was capable of giving him, and my heart ached for him, though at times I just wanted to give him a good spanking.Leslie was a good friend and I would have liked to have gotten to know her better, I think she and I would have been friends.While I enjoyed this book, it wasn't my favorite of Ms. Forster's works. I just couldn't warm up to Elizabeth and that kept me from giving her any sympathy and took away from the book for me.I recommend anyone who enjoys a good chick lit to draw a hot bubble bath, grab a glass of their favorite beverage and settle in, they won't be disappointed.Member of the Paranormal Romance Guild Dual Review Team",1
400,5,"I didn't know what to expect in Heather's version of Neverland, but I wasn't disappointed and I was both amazed and happy with the results.  Let's just say that it's not your typical sequel, and it will give you more of a back story or at least hints on how it all began.  It can be frustrating and depressing at times, but it's still exciting, provocative, funny, inspiring, and over-all it's a hell of a ride.  Enjoy it, and along with the rest of us, keep on bugging the author to produce more stories like this especially those about the characters that we already fell in love with.Heather Killough-Walden is a very creative and daring writer. She makes great dialogue, unexpected twists, memorable and lovable characters (even the antagonists), and all her plots are very well written.  I've been following her for years, along with other fans who discovered her in some of the first websites she contributed to.  Like many of them, and those who have found her through recommendations, she has quickly became the top ""favorite"" and to me the main reason why I kept on going back to those websites, waiting for the next installments to her stories which are always in the fantasy or sci-fi realm, although sometimes they were also very sensual.Keep them coming Heather!",1

403,4,"The second book in the Savage Sanctuary series is an intriguing, hot and steamy romance.

404,4,"This story had me engaged right from the first page.  The antagonistic witty dialogue sucked me right in and I knew then and there I had to hang on to my seat because it would be a fun and wild ride.Liz is a Fae warrior who's very insecure because she's only 1/16th Fae, therefore not as strong as more pureblood Fae.  During her first test as a warrior, she's set up against Jack Morgan, a vampire who's allied with her Fae clan.  Due to his lackluster comments, and the fact that he's a vampire, Liz grows to absolutely hate Jack. Unfortunately for Liz, when she's left alone protecting the city against a new homicidal threat she realizes she needs help.  When her best pal Celia finds the solution, Liz is horror struck to learn that in order to defeat this enemy, she needs to perform a ritual to gain another's power.  More specifically, the ritual states she needs to have sex with a vampire to gain his power and there's only one in the city who's not her mortal enemy.This short story, about 800 kindle pages, starts with explosive chemistry between Liz and Jack, even though Liz is nothing less than a total witch to Jack.  Attempting the ritual is an absolute train wreck that you can't seem to tear away from that ends up turning into absolute fireworks.  Unfortunately, because of its too short length, everything thereafter happens so quickly and ends, that I felt a little let down that it wasn't drawn out a little more.  Regardless, it was a fast and very entertaining read.  Evidently, this is the first of a short story series with Celia highlighted in the next, however I can't help but hope this author writes an actual full length novel instead.",1
405,5,"Just finished the second book in the series and I have to admit there were times when my heart dropped into my stomach and started beating wild. Now that is the effect I seek when I read a Ghost Story.  I loved the fact that Allie Mae's Ghost reappeared in this book. The other Ghost was more evil and a lot more bloodier than Allie Mae was. I actually thought of him more of a Demon and maybe at times it got a bit too gory. I kinda prefer the hauntings Allie Mae style, she was really easy to picture which was great.The author does a great job in building the tension, where you just have to keep reading to see what will happen next. The story flows easy and the characters are described great. Can't wait for the third one in the series.",1

I loved the characters and the slow build up in the beginning. If I don't love the characters I have a hard time finishing the book.It had the right amount of characterization and great atmosphere through out. Really if you are on the fence about buying this book, you should do it. It's more than worth the money. You'll love it!",1
409,4,"This short e-book taught me things I didn't know about Amazon.com, my favorite website  The author was born in India and has lived the American dream as a computer technologist, first in Silicon Valley and later for Amazon.com.  He and his family moved to Seattle after a long and grueling interview process.  He was paid well but the job required as much as 80 hours of work a week.  He describes Seattle well, its' warm and bright summers and its' cold and rainy winters.  He also describes the impact that living there had on his wife and children.  Especially interesting to me was the Amazon.com working culture, which was indeed hard on the employees as Amazon created the mammoth business that it is today.The book is fast-paced and easy to read, the author a likable guy.  Amazon is a hard place to work for and many of his opinions are certainly not complementary although I could easily see the business genius of Jeff Bezos.  Eventually, Mr. Kalpanik left the company but his recollections depict a time and a place and an industry that is indeed unique and will certainly be applauded as a business model for many years to come.",1

412,4,"Wow!  I really enjoyed Uncivil Liberties.  I have had this title on my Kindle for a couple of months, but just now got around to it.  I am kinda glad I did wait.  This book is the 2nd Pug Conner book and does followState of Rebellion (A Pug Connor Novel).  State of Rebellion ended nicely, but left enough open to make you want to read the next book in the series.  But Uncivil Liberties ended with a cliff-hanger of sorts and at first I went agggghh!  But then I remembered that I have the 3rd book in this series,To Faithfully Execute (A Pug Connor Novel #3), already on my Kindle.  Thank goddness!  I was so caught up in the storyline that the ending came so fast and I was left hanging........In my review title I made a reference to Tom Clancy and that is a good thing.  I love his novels, and I think Gordon can hold his own in comparison.  The combination of characters Pug Connor and Carlos Castro match up very well with Clancy's stars ofDead or Alive(John Clark and ""Ding"" Chavez).  I would love to read a story about just Carlos Castro.  Carlos could make the Punisher look tame!All in all, this 2nd book in the Pug Connor series is very well written.  If you enjoyed State of Rebellion at all, you will love this story.  If you have never tried a Gordon Ryan novel, I would start with State of Rebellion and then get this one to catch up.  I heard he has a 4th book lined up as well.  I will be along for the ride.",1
413,5,"As Lady Amara's illness continues to worsen, the shortness of time drives her to finish the ledger she has promised Count Drugeth. He has only recently sought her out in in effort to know more about his family and the history that plagues them. Only now as she looks back, writing and reflecting on her life as the ladies maid and confident of Countess Bathory, does the time seem right to set to paper the truth of what really occurred, both the joys and the horror. History would remember Countess Bathory as the Blood Countess and one of the fist women serial killers in written history, Amara would remember her as a friend.In Hidden will of the Dragon, Charlie Courtland takes you back to the late 15th and early 16th century where women were unable to inherit and were traded in marriage in order to improve the coffers or standing of her family. Marriages were set up as business propositions and women had no choice in the matter. The same is true for Elizabeth Bathory, and because her husband is a soldier she is sent into isolation in the Hungarian countryside to reside in Cathcice.The descriptions of the day as well as the characters pull you in and you feel the hopelessness and despair, almost as though you were there in that time and place.Lady Amara, her friend and companion is with her through everything, a constant in her life that is so rare. I was initially fooled by Amara, thinking her to be that friend and confidant that would be the strength to deal with Elizabeth's demons. I was disappointed to find that Amara not only had her own demons but that she was pulled into some of Elizabeth's madness as well.Charlie Courtland has taken a time and event in history and put a story to it that would rival the actual events. She takes the reported facts as well as many of the rumors of the day and spins them into a story so believable that is could be the true events as they transpired.This story is not for the weak of heart as there is much madness and despair. Be prepared to be sucked into the story and become a part of it. You will see the blood spatters and will feel the actual weight of the horror as it unfolds.I would recommend this book with the understanding that it is not lighthearted reading. I believe it would be great for a book club or a reading group. There is a great deal of information that would be interesting to discuss.",1

416,5,"Selena, a dual citizenship Mexican/American has been raised in Mexico her whole life.  After losing her family in cartel violence, she braves the border crossing by herself, $25 in her pocket, hoping to find her grandparents in Texas.  Walking, she makes it just outside of Laredo before she is attacked.  A ranch hand finds her, and, thinking she is a boy, takes her to the ranch.  The ranch owner, Travis, recognizes immediately that she is a female.  He takes her into his house, wanting her to rest until she is healed.  Having no money, she soon becomes his housekeeper.  Travis is incredibly attracted to her, but Selena is a virgin, and strict about keeping herself pure until marriage.  Of course, Travis was a champion bull rider, and has lots experience with women giving him what he wants.  Travis is also a very controlling man.  He wants Selena for himself, and hates sharing her attention with the other men.  However, no matter how controlling Travis gets, it never felt like he might harm Selena.Overall, I really enjoyed this love story.  The reader gets to experience the hero and heroine grow and and develop as their love for each other makes them better people.  There are lots of sensuous and sexual scenes that don't involve intercourse, and were really well written.  Later in the book there are also some pretty descriptive intercourse/losing virginity scenes.  It is a decent length, at 2416 kindle locations.I've read two stories by author Lynda Chance, this one andBlackmailed Into Bed (Contemporary Romance).  Both stories contained controlling males, but I strongly preferred Travis, and this love story.",1

418,4,"In the last year, I've read a lot of short fiction, from novelettes down to collections of ""drabbles"" (100 word flash fiction stories). Judging works of different lengths was difficult until I realized the same rules applied. While more focused, to make a good read, shorter works require the same elements as a novel, only less. You need enough characterization to understand the motivations, history, and personality of the character for the specific story. Too much detail is bad, just like trying to give too much detail about a character in a novel. The same concept applies to plot or any other story element we might think of.This story hit the mark. We learn a lot about Dan Cooper, the protagonist, because as the main character and narrator we need to understand him the most. Gomez fills us in on life events that brought him to his situation as the story starts. We understand his motivations and why he reacts the way he does. The minor characters we get to know just enough, but not too much. The plot is tightly focused and appropriate for the length. Last, there is a twist at the end, which I especially appreciate in short fiction.**Originally written for ""Books and Pals"" book blog. May have received a free review copy. **",1
419,5,"Professor Elliot Mills used to be an FBI agent. He likes teaching, but doesn't hesitate to get back into action when a student disappears and the case seems suspicious. Elliot's ex-lover, FBI Agent Tucker Lance, is working the case and doesn't want Elliot around, regardless of his experience. Elliot and Tucker find it difficult to be in the same room together after how badly their relationship ended, but soon Elliot's making more progress than anyone else on the case. As Elliot and Tucker try to make peace with their past, Elliot becomes the killer's next target.While I do masochistically enjoy the angsty romantic hell Josh Lanyon usually puts me through while reading his books, Fair Game has a little less gut wrenching heartache than his norm, and I loved it just as much. Lanyon has the expert ability to write realistic, suspenseful tales. Countless times throughout Fair Game I found myself pegging the villain only to realize I was mistaken yet again. The plot is not contrived or obtrusive, and it kept me riveted to each intriguing page. Along with an exciting storyline, Fair Game stars two very appealing men. Excellent characterization brings Tucker and Elliot to life. Despite the fact that Elliot is a professor now, he's a detective at heart and he plays that role amazingly well. He and Tucker make a terrific crime fighting team. Tucker has regrets, except his pride gets in the way of making things right. While they have a lot in common and are compatible in and out of the bedroom, it's that same common ground that causes strife between them. Sex between Elliot and Tucker is hard, hot, and meaningful, but it's not the focal point of their story. Fair Game is a novel of suspense with well-penned eroticism. It's the next great story in Josh Lanyon's arsenal of well-written gay suspense novels.NannetteReviewed",1

Sentu wants to learn the new letters of Pharaoh Menes's court. This book takes you on the journey and the price he pays to learn his letters. The author has a way of describing her words where you actually feel like you are there in the story witnessing the incidents first hand. Her descriptions can be so realistic at time, that you will find yourself feeling the characters pain or getting goose bumps(seriously). The downfall of the story is I didn't like the way it ended. I wanted more. Don't just leave me wanting more. The author endings are NEVER predictable.",1

The main character is a teen who was sent to live with foster parents at a young age. He is suddenly ""called"" home, only to find that the Uncle who called him has since passed away. He is to become the next ""Grimm Huntsman"" and take his Uncle's place. He meets his Uncle's apprentice, and the two of them set out to take on the ""fairy tale"" creatures living in their midst.

I was also thoroughly pleased to read an author who did not need gratuitous sex scenes to carry the story line.  I loved it and would recommend it.",1

432,5,"The story of a woman of a certain age, single, kids grown, living in a once-dream home which is now too far out, too isolated, and too much, One Hundred Open Houses follows the heroine's adventures as she tries to find affordable housing in NYC. She ""talks"" as she visits the apartments for sale, talking to the reader, or maybe herself. It's very interesting, intelligent, observant self-talk. I don't have my Kindle with me right now to give you an example, but I'd gasp at the insights the author offered into life and aging, and real estate. This may not be the book for everyone, but it sure was for me. I am woman of a certain age, whose kids are grown, my husband and I live on a ranch. The nearest grocery (not up-scale food emporium, just regular grocery) is six miles away. I think about moving all the time. Where to? Can I afford anything farther in? Would I want it if I could? Do I really want to give up what I've got for a hovel in the city?Also, I love looking at real estate. And open houses. I could easily lovingly catalog every open house I visited if I got serious about moving. I liked visiting all those places in the book.

436,5,"Tara Lain is one of my favorite authors and I have thoroughly enjoyed all of her books. So you can imagine that I was anxiously awaiting the release of her new book Volley Balls. Her previous two books Genetic Attraction and The Scientist and the Supermodel were wonderfully written. I didn't want them to end! Volley Balls was no different. This short novel is a sweet story about three men coming together unexpectedly and revealing things about one another they never expected. Oh yeah..... did I mention that it's HOT!!! The sex scenes had my heart racing and my body sweating. The image I had in my head (from Ms. Lains excellent descriptions) of how these men look made those sex scenes that much hotter!David is a genuinely nice guy who has a past that he is trying to forget. He meets Gareth who is sweet and loving which is something that David is not use to. Can the feelings Gareth has towards David help bring him out of a closet he's lived in his whole life? Enter Edge, who is gorgeous but unkind to David at first. Why? Well, he has his own issues to deal with as well. Can these three gorgeous men find love?Ms. Lain again did not disappoint. Her books always display an array of emotions. She has a way of grabbing the readers attention from page one and keeping it until the final page is read. Volley Balls is no different. I would have read this book in one sitting but unfortunately, life got in the way! This book made me smile and kept me fascinated. Ms. Lain is a terrific author and I can't wait to read Deceptive Attraction which follows Caleb from The Scientist and the Supermodel along with her m/m/m romantic suspense book called Golden Dancer.So please visit her website [...] to find out all the latest information on her books. And don't just take my word for it.... go and read them all yourself. I promise you will not be disappointed with any of them.

But make sure you are at a pool with lots of hot men so you can let your imagination go wild ;-)",1

I was first introduced to this world in the novella, Reveal Me. I loved that quickie and I love how this one was a full length novel.Kelly and Spencer work together at The Book Nook, both 100% committed to their jobs. Being the boss, Spencer attempts to keep Kelly in line but usually he fails...miserably. Kelly is unlike most of the women he's ever known. Strong and vocal but slightly insecure with herself. Imagine his surprise when he not only finds her PDA with her list of sexual conquests, but also his office security tape has a very raunchy video of Kelly riding solo on his couch. Now the girl with the bright ideas that is as innovative has she is sexy has caught his attention.Kelly isn't used to being sexually open. She certainly isn't used to the sex club, Kink, her friend has drug her to. What surprises her most though is seeing her sexually frustrating boss, Spencer hooking up some some random chick in the steam room. Spencer is the man she has lusted after for years. If she has to open her mind to the idea of voyeuristic sex, well she will give it everything she has.Wow, just wow. This book was so incredibly hot. Every scene just a bit hotter then the last. Through it all though is a great story. Who hasn't fantasized about a boss at some point in their life? Being taken on a desk in the boss mans office, is just...achingly sextastic. It's erotic. And the ways Spencer takes Kelly. Alone...with some helpful hands at the Kink club....awesome.Yes, there are a few scenes that involve additional players...so beware.Spencer was great. So stoic and in control. Watching his control shatter again and again was.....well it was....fantastic. He is a man haunted by his past mistakes and unable to deny himself of Kelly over and over again. She is everything that is missing in his life. Loving, sexual and just a great partner.Kelly is a strong woman. Her tongue is quick to attack both verbally and sexually. She is the kind of person any girl would want in her court and any man would trip over to get to. Loyal and devoted to her job as well his her smoking hot boss.Spencer doesn't know any other life away from The Book Nook. It's his calling in life. Nothing can derail him from his position in Virginia. Yes it means moving for a year at least but the benefits outweigh the sacrifice. Until Kelly shows him that his job isn't everything. That life can be worth so much more.I give Provoke Me by Cari Quinn 5 stars!Nikki- Ramblings From A Chaotic Mind",1

Kern builds the story so well and I was so connected with the McDermott family and their little town that I immediately bought Here Comes Trouble the second I finished this book. I love a book that I can lose myself in and that's what I've found in Kern. I absolutely love this book, the detail, the robust characters and the descriptive writing.

441,4,"In the second Rhine Maiden novel, we find our protagonist, Piper, a member of newly formed investigation/assassination squad for the supernatural Guardians.  Somewhat similar to the first book (free, at least for now) in writing style and characterizations, Evans' strongest point remains the portrayal of family life and how difficult raising kids is (not that I have any myself, but I'm told I was an unholy terror.  And I've babysat).  The plot was a fairly traditional urban-fantasy/paranormal ""find the true murderer before time runs out,"" with a few twists and turns along the way that are pretty predictable once you've read half a dozen other, similarly themed novels.  That said, it was well executed, and the editing is pretty good, excellent for a dollar novel.  There is, similar to the first book, a continued theme of ""life is precious""/pro-life philosophy that was a bit clunky and unbelievable, but didn't annoy so much I stopped reading.  Overall, a pretty good book, with some hilarious family scenes.",1

I started this book only this morning and put it down only to go to church.  This book is a gem. History buffs will be drawn to it but others should not be put off by the Nuremberg trials.  The character development is superb including an Army version of Wouk's Captain Queeq from Caine Mutiny. The twists and turns kept me enthralled.  Just when I thought the story was over I was hit with a surprise ending I didn't see coming. This book doesn't disappoint.",1
443,5,"This is the second novel I've read and reviewed by Sarah Madison and totally enjoyed. She is going on my auto-buy list from now on. Unspeakable Words starts out as your typical Gay-For-You plot, namely one gay FBI agent, Jerry Parker who falls for his new straight partner, John Flynn. They are trying to catch a serial killer called the Grimm Fairy Tale killer. Then, out of the blue, the novel takes a decidedly unique turn and goes from a mystery-romance novel to a mystery-romance-paranormal-esque book. The change was utterly unexpected and instead of throwing me out of the plot, rather it enhanced the story and made me appreciate the characters in a totally new way. (I wish I could give away the big reveal, but I think if you suspend disbelief and go with it, you'll really enjoy it.)As witnessed by her other novel, Crying for the Moon, Sarah Madison is able to take what you initially think are rather ordinary characters and turn them in extraordinary human beings with compelling back stories and endearing personalities traits. I feel madly in love with Jerry: cat lover and workaholic. His FBI partner, John was equally engrossing -- he's the one who gets the ""unpredictable powers"" - and their chemistry, while building very slowly adds to the sense of tension in the book. And while the Grimm Fairy Tale killer is not caught in this book (I am hoping for a sequel), the mystery element is still present and palpable throughout the piece.So, if you enjoy a good mystery, combined with a lot of underlying sexual tension that builds and builds, cute cats and a paranormal subplot, I think you will love Unspeakable Words.Dark Divas Reviews",1

450,5,"I know, I know, another Marcia Lynn McClure book. I&#8217;m not sure what it is or why I love her books so much. I have friends that absolutely adore her books and friends who roll their eyes at them. They are clean, sappy, totally predictable and I adore them. I do admit there are some editing mistakes but I can easily overlook the errors and get lost in the story. Marcia is a fabulous storyteller.The Windswept Flame is a companion book to Weathered Too Young. Although The Windswept Flame can stand alone I would recommend you read Weathered Too Young first.Marcia&#8217;s books are all very predictable. It may seem odd but that is part of the reason I love them. While reading this book I kept waiting for certain things to happen because they always happen in her Historical Romances.I love that her books are real &#8220;old-fashioned&#8221; romances. There is never anything more than some passionate kissing. I love that the characters blush at innuendo. Her characters are hard working, honest people who care about and look out for others. They are uplifting and make me smile.I&#8217;ve never been disappointed with one of Marcia&#8217;s books. They are my favorite escape. If you like good clean romance I recommend you give her a try.Content: A clean read with nothing more than kissing and a couple of the mildest of expletives that aren&#8217;t allowed to be uttered in my house but that I allow in a book like this.Rating: 5 Stars because I didn&#8217;t want to put it down.",1
451,4,"I have to admit it took me a page or two to figure out that the author had chosen to define the characters by their roles and not their names. I did for a short moment think that he had perhaps had a slight language black hole. The story is about Waif, who is indeed a waif with a birthmark and she lives in Great House with Young Master (you get it now, right...and can maybe understand why I had to read the first two pages twice). Is she the solution to an ancient family curse? I won't go into too many details, it would give away the story. Suffice to say the writer does actually explain his different approach at the end of the story. I enjoyed it and the whole ""no the"" issue made me chuckle, as I was saying it out loud when I read, which I am sure is a sign of total language OCD. Very entertaining.Waif (A fantasy short story from Greyhart Press)",1

455,5,"Open Mic is written in a style and format that captured me from the very first paragraph. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this and it had me laughing out loud in some places which is unusual for me to find humour in a book of any kind, although reading is fun!!Enjoyable all the way through and written by a true entertainer that has set out to entertain from the pages of Open Mic and has achieved this goal to pinpoint the audience or rather readers. I can't wait to finish Open Mic vol.2, if it's as enjoyable as this one then its going to be a massive hit!!A definite must read and a good price to purchase.Laurie BowlerAuthor of the following:Moon Rising,Sunrise to SunsetSerena Embracing DarknessThe Depths of DarknessAcross The City (Short stories)I've Given You My HeartBroken Spirit (as seen in Chocolate Rose Anthology)",1

Ariel is lost and confused and can't stop obsessing over what happened to Jenna, but meets and befriends the new girl Theo, who helps her feel like she's not such an outcast in Hell. Oh, yeah, Hell is the name of the town they live in. Can you say creepy? Along comes Henry, the new boy that seems to have a thing for Ariel, but they're from 2 different social classes, which ends up causing problems, of course. Soon Ariel starts seeing ghosts and hearing things, little girls start disappearing, and Ariel and her friends are trying to find out what's going on in Hell.I got a little spooked while reading this, and a little miffed at the unfairness between social classes, which is good for Abigail Boyd, since she was able to keep and hold my attention while leaving me wanting more!

If you haven't read any of Haines' work, pick up Louis or February the Fifth and you'll immediately become a fan.February the Fifth is a fun galactic journey of a boy trying to discover what it takes to become the man he needs to be to lead his kingdom. Feb meets some very unique characters along the way while engaging in some very memorable good (and not so good) times. Like Haines' other book, the character development is unparalleled.

463,4,"~* 3.5 Stars *~Fresh from the cold and bloody battlefield of war and worn in heart and soul because of it, Lord Adam Fizroy has stopped for a brief repast while on the journey back to his family estate when his private dining area is breached by a seductively beautiful woman...who is quite obviously in need of his help. He is captivated by her exotic beauty and honor-bound to assist the woman, a Mrs. Smith. He secrets her away from the brute who is chasing her and drops her off at a vicarage not far from his home.Imagine his surprise and abject disappointment, then, when the same captivating woman bursts in on him yet again just an hour later after he's taken himself off to the familiar arms of an old friend and bawdy house proprietress. Or his fury and horror when the seductive little liar is also introduced the next morning as his own dear mother's companion.Not only does the female lie exceptionally well, but she's one of the most brazen bawdy ladies he's ever had the misfortune to meet! Adam is highly vexed and intent on bringing the dangerously seductive Mrs. Smith to heel. And he is not above using a most scandalous proposition to do so.Florentina Grantley is incensed by the gall of Lord Fizroy, she being a widow, not a lady of ill repute, but she's also in a very precarious position. She must not lose her position with the Lord's mother. Too many people, her youngest siblings in particular, depend on her and the benefits her position and the location affords. Lives are at stake, after all.Left with no choice but to knuckle under and accept Lord Fizroy's indecent proposition, she's both stimulated by the thought and terrified. She is not the experienced woman he will be expecting to please him and unless she can pass as exactly what he thinks she is her cause will be lost...along with the lives of countless innocents she's determined to save.~*~I'm not at all ashamed to admit that I squealed a little in fierce female pleasure when I realized that Florentina's character was written to have been a spy for the British back in her native country of Spain, guiding troops and providing information against the occupying forces of France during the early years of the Napoleonic Wars. This was, of course, before her arrival in England - the details of which form the motivation for almost every single one of her actions in the book.I loved the idea of a female lead so well versed in rebellion and so proven in indomitable spirit. That's my kind of heroine. Pity the male lead, Adam, was such a hypocritical wanker in comparison, really. And I don't care what sort of justification Florentina's prostitute friend gave for Adam's words and actions, his unguarded and razor-sharp disdain for the possibility of Florentina being a prostitute given where he spends his randy times and how dear a friend he considered the bawdy house's madam to be just turned me off him completely.Then came the night of the propositioned meeting and...well...everything shifted a little and the book really started to roll.I ended up being fairly amused and impressed with Adam and too frequently perplexed by Florentina, who, for being a spy and repeatedly claiming she was capable of handling herself, proved to be more timid than I would have expected, with a nature that was more on the prim an proper side. And she was a horrible liar who got herself into trouble all the time through a series of questionable actions and rash decisions. Her character wasn't by any means unpleasant, but her personality and actions definitely seemed in conflict with her backstory to me.The human trafficking storyline was quite nicely done. I found that part of the book highly entertaining. I wasn't fond at all of the threads surrounding Adam's ex-intended, who is now the current wife of Adam's brother, the Duke. That whole plot line didn't appeal to me, and it was a significant enough part of the book to create some overall dissatisfaction, especially after the conclusion, which seemed very anticlimactic and a odd to me.The concept of the book and the originality of the characters would have maintained their appeal had the book been more even and the characters more consistent. As it is, it's a book with high points and low points, with characters I liked very much in some spots, but absolutely couldn't tolerate in others. Some things went well, some things didn't. Not everything was explained well or fully fleshed out, but some things were wonderfully detailed. Overall I was left thinking that the book had it's ups and downs.Disclosure: An ARC of this book was provided to me by Carina Press via NetGalley. This rating, review, and all included thoughts and comments are my own.~*~*~*~Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",1
464,5,"Very enjoyable and funny.  Especially liked that the hero isn't described as extra tall, extra handsome, extra...whatever.  Would/Will definitely read more by this author, very few actually make me laugh out loud, and this book did.  (Check out the possible uses for unicorn poo.)",1
465,4,"This book is well written, has good character development and storyline. It's told from the perspective of several characters, which can be a bit confusing using Kindle's Text-to-Speech, until the fact dawns on the reader / listener.This took me several chapters, lol. For visual readers, each chapter is clearly marked by name of it's narrator. But even without, eventually their distinct personallies will make deciphering each simple.Once again this book has a &#34;New Age&#34; undercurrent, but add to it Wicca, Fortune Telling, Runes and you have a full blown Pagan feel. There was one part in the book that referred to the book &#34;Left Behind&#34; as &#34;Christian propaganda crap&#34;, and in the context of not wanting their child to read it.As for the rest of this book, again, well written ... The story revolves around a group of woman, those in their lives, andemotional hardships they face. I feel it's unfortunate that the Author chose to attack another faith while pushing spirituallity, relaxation, herbs and whatnot of every other non-Christian belief. Took so much from her book.",1

It caught me off-guard, is what I'm getting at.If you haven't done so already, get the book, and read it.  I Promise you will NOT regret it.",1
467,5,"I loved this story, really did. In fact, I am in love with Anne Calhoun's stories. I just finished ""Liberating Lacey"" and could not get enough. Ms Calhoun is a very passionate, talented and emotional writer which bring those qualities in her characters. I like how she sets and keeps the mood for her stories.""What She Needs"" is actually too short bt still its impact is immense. It is too hard to figure out the logistics of the storyline bt that is not so much the point: what matters is how the reader gets there, understand the characters, embrace them and experience with them their own emotions. I like the bit of postscript at the end. The characters were believable and their situation vivid.Loved ""What She Needs"" and ""Liberating Lacey"", now I want more stories by ms. Calhoun; she is a strong and intense writer. I like it!! I love it!!",1

469,5,"Speedloader showcases the latest neo-noir talent to emerge in recent times. Comprising of six short stories touching on topics from war memorials, deranged police officers, alcoholic obsessive delinquents, sex trafficking, drug addled journalism, and anti drug task forces this anthology is loaded with enough speed to keep you awake for days. Nigel Birds 'You Dirty Rat' is a nostalgic piece retelling the horrific journey of a soldier and his fallen comrade. 'Plastic Soldiers' by W.D. Country is nothing short of brilliant - with such a small window to capture the readers imagination, Country crafts a tale that's both gripping, heart wrenching and motivating all in a single beat as we watch 6 young boys try to live through their captivity whilst enduring unspeakable acts horror and misconduct. The collection continues to get better with 'Cuffs' by Matthew C. Funk in which a deranged cop frames an innocent man for the brutal murder of a woman - you want shock and awe? 'Cuffs' has it in abundance - a very well executed tale of all that is noir. 'Mori Obscura' by Nik Korpon sees a 'clean' journo end up at one of his former drug house haunts and forced to decided between relapse and redemption. Much like 'Cuffs' and 'Plastic Soldiers' before it, 'Mori Obscura' is packed with tension and beautifully defined characters and plot. The second to last story in 'Herniated Roots' by Richard Thomas was the only bump on an otherwise smooth road - I struggled to connect with the lead character and wasn't as compelled to read it as I was with the other stories - perhaps a testament to the quality of the others. Last but not least is quiet possibly the best short story I've ever read in Jonathan Woods' brilliant 'Crash and Burn' about an ill fated attempt to bring down a Mexican drug plantation in operation Fig Leaf. Reminiscent of the movie 'Smoking Aces' in so much as it comprises a cast of crazies doomed for death and hellbent on destruction. Inclusive of bar room brawls, submission, military misconduct, Mexican drug cartels and promiscuous women 'Crash and Burn' is hands down the best of the best, the most engrossing and unrelenting blood pumping short story I've ever read. I hope Woods explores some of the great characters he created for 'Crash and Burn' further in a full length novel. Minor qualms aside (Herniated Roots) this is a very solid anthology by the future of neo-noir - jump on and enjoy the ride. 4.5 stars.",1

I read the first book in 12 hours and immediately read the 2nd book in the following 12 hours. I haven't quite enjoyed a book series like this in quit a while. I love how the story progressed and we the reader learned more about the main plot of the story line, and I love the two main characters even though this book separated them for most of the book, it still was fascinating to read and wonder when a chance encounter would happen again. It was also great to learn more about their relationship in this book. As we all know that Daniel is a mysterious main character and has secrets, I just didn't expect the one that Clare found out in this one, my heart went out to her, and also my understanding went out to Daniel, because his secrecy had been because of pure reasons, his love for her. This book added new characters and more details to the overall plot. The writer did a great job planning out this book, i never once got bored or had to take a break out of annoyance. She did a great job! Now about the end of the book, I will not give too much of a spoiler, but I have to say that the ending has me a bit worried just like our main character in the book. I  had to buy the 3rd installment of the book and I cant wait to see what is going to happen next. Another fantastic read and a must buy! You will not be disappointed!!",1

I kept waiting for Justin to kiss Rachel or Janie, but it never happened. The action was fast-paced and kept me on the edge of my seat.I would recommend this book to anyone from ages eleven to about fourteen or fifteen, although I'm sure people older than that would enjoy it as well. However, I don't recommend that children under ten read this because although there's no sex or cursing, the whole book contains a bunch of pedophiles doing sick things (nothing is described in great detail, with the exception of one scene where a guy tries to molest someone).Again, this book addresses polygamy and its affect on all people. Go buy the book. Now. I command you.~Kelly",1

I was quickly engrossed, and I could imagine a plot line of this short story being turned into a full-length novel: it would be interesting to see how the story plays out.If you are looking for a quick 5-10 minute read during your lunch break (and I was), this is a good one to grab.",1

487,4,"This was really a pretty good book.  You feel for the characters, there's fun banter between them, and you get to read about some demons...kind of like watching Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel.I have two issues with this book, though. 1) The ending fell kind of flat after building up the romance between the two main characters.  2) There were LOTS of errors in the book.  Extra words added, probably when the author decided to change the sentence and didn't get all of the original sentence off the page. Words used incorrectly, such as to instead of too, or vice versa, etc. Words left out that should have been there. This book could have used a good editor.  Every book I've read lately has had a few errors. Someone pointed out three in one of my own books.  But this one was full of them.  Still a good read, though.",1

Someone who does everything from looking for places to find entertainment for the night, to dates, to selling and buying things. She even decided to become a escort for a brief, and I do mean brief, time. The story was well thought out and pretty realistic when it comes to life struggles, from finding a roommate, to the perfect man. It gets a little unbelievable towards the end, where the main character has a sudden &#8230; experience...to say for lack of spoilers, that is very less than true to life, more like dumb luck, but more than that, it&#8217;s like all authors feel the need to show that everyone has a happy ending. I don&#8217;t like it when authors conform to the &#8216;the world is perfect&#8217; viewpoint most books have, but, that&#8217;s just my pessimist breaking through.The book needs some serious editing, she&#8217;s repeated the same exact line 3-4 times a couple times, and is HYPHEN-CRAZY...hyphenating words that shouldn't be hyphenated, like every-one, or some-thing, disappoint-ted. Aside from that, a few spelling errors, and a few words left out or in the wrong order in sentences, and it was a pretty good read. there wasn't a LOT of spelling errors, so it didn't make it difficult to read, and I only had to reread a few sentences because of the wording, so it wasn't terrible in that aspect either.All in all I&#8217;d give the book 4 stars.

Each one was connected, as each of the characters knew each other from high school, but each one had their own unique story to be told.***In Glad Tidings, Hoornstra tells Jake and Bethany's story. It's filled with a little heartache. After all, Bethany just lost her husband, who just happened to be Jake's friend. Seeing Jake again, cause all kinds of feelings for Bethany, bringing back memories from the past for both of them. I absolutely adored both Bethany and Jake and really loved watching them realize their feelings for each, 25 years later! The sparks constantly fly, and the romance is captivating.***In Next Tuesday At Two, Hoornstra changes things up a bit. Matt and Blane are friends from the past. In fact, they aren't really friends. They just recently met when Matt invests in Blane, but the sparks fly instantly and they fight it. When Blane leaves to head to her class reunion, Matt won't let her go with out a fight so he follows her. After that, the past catches up to both of them, and the story really takes off! With passion and fireworks, Hoornstra created an engaging, fast read.In To Be or Not, Barry and Amanda's story is my favorite of the three. Barry wronged Amanda in high school, and he's never forgotten it....or her. Amanda hasn't either. Neither one want to go to the class reunion, but can they risk their hearts a second time? This one was a wonderfully gripping story that flew by too fast for me. I didn't want to say good bye to Barry and Amanda. Watching them together, seeing them move on from the past and the forgiveness shine through, added so much depth to this fast read.I totally recommend all three of Ms. Hoornstra's stories. They're fast reads, and perfect for that relaxing evening. These stories are the perfect tellings of second chances and romance mixed with heartache and forgiveness.  All are 5 Book worthy, and captured me completely. I am now a forever fan of Ms. Hoornstra's work! I can't wait to see what she has in store for old and NEW fans!*This review is based on a complimentary copy which was provided for an honest review*",1
494,5,"I'm rather a fool for Laurie King's Mary Russell novels. She tells stories from the viewpoint of a brilliant and articulate woman who solves intricate puzzles. Mary Russell is is immersed in the issues of her era (largely the 1920s), such as the politics in Palestine or the position of women after World War I. I am always impatient for her NEXT book.But this short story kept me occupied for a little while -- and if you are a Mary Russell fan, I think you'll like it too.In short: It tells the ""Russell and Holmes meet"" story from Holmes' point of view. Including incidents that Russell never learned about.This is a short story. It doesn't go into the loving detail that we novel-readers expect from King's writing. That's okay with me. I think it's of interest primarily to earlier fans, rather than an easy introduction to the full story. (And God knows I have pressed enough copies ofThe Beekeeper's Apprenticeupon my friends, who must think that I get a kickback.)The ""Twitter interview"" at the end didn't work for me, even though I am an avid Twitter user. But that's okay. The short story is a good short story... and worth the money.",1
495,4,Is an enchanting book could not put it down.  A true paranormal mystery.  It has the true feeling of good friends that enjoy each others company.  This a must read book.,1
496,5,"There's nothing I like more than a good page turner and a book that I cannot put down. I was more than satisfied when I came across ""Fury from Within"" by Francis Smith. The character development is superb and the story really comes to life right off of the pages. You can tell that the author's personal experiences in the Armed Forces and travels around the world have made this book the great read that it is. I could not put it down and cannot wait to read more books by this author. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read.",1
497,5,"I like my Kindles, and this is a nicely made device. Hmm, just like the one that should have been included with my Kindle. It's a marketing decision, and not a good one. You need one, so get it.  Just be grumpy about it, like me.",1
498,5,"First, let me say that I'm not a big reader of scary books because I'm a total wuss. Having said that, I really enjoyed The House. It is well-written and has a light-hearted New Adult feel, even if at times it was too scary for me to read late at night, just in case I needed to get up in the dark for a drink of water (thank heavens I don't have stairs). The characters are exceptionally well-drawn and the family dynamics will draw you in almost as much as the riveting, spooky plot.Of course, as for most horror books or movies, there are moments where you think ""Just get out of there--Now!"" and of course the characters never do, but the sheer entertainment factor, the creepy happenings, and the enchanting love story between Susan and Sloan will make you overlook that. Sloan, of course, is a real gem. He's the kind of sexy but lovely boy next door we'd all love to be ours, and that is where I feel this book really shines. There's a ""realness"" and a romanticism to the characters and to the setting that makes them feel homey--like people you've met in real life. The reason for that only becomes clear later in the novel. I'd recommend this book for teens, young adults, or adults who love three-dimensional characters who could be you, me, or anyone put in a truly freaky situation, and who relish that feeling of a chill prickling the back of their necks and seek smoothly written witch or paranormal fiction that will keep them flipping the pages to the very end.Adkins is definitely a force to watch out for in New Adult horror and paranormal.",1
499,4,"Ever is a warrior and has been patrolling the borders of the Badlands for the past seven years. The Badlands is a separate country, near Texas. It is her job to take the men the United States sends to prison, and keep them secure in the prisons of the Badlands. She is not afraid to kill men  - anything to keep her Queen and the Badlands safe. But someone is out to overthrow the monarchy, and soon her Queen is dead. Badly injured, Ever needs to get to Philadelphia to retrieve the princess to restore order, for without a ruler, chaos ensues.Making a run in his dirigible to the Badlands, Captain Spencer Pierce needs the money he will make off of unloading cargo in this dangerous land. His ship, the Dark Hawk is not really his yet - still owned by Congressman Mason. While making this run, he sees a very badly injured woman, and picks her up to save her. In doing this, he is unable to unload his cargo as the atmosphere is rife with violence. But if he helps Ever recover the princess, he will be compensated, able to secure the Dark Hawk as his. As they go forth in this dangerous mission, they both reluctantly build an attraction.Badlands starts right in the middle of action. Boom! You are immersed in this steampunk world. For this reason, it took me a little while to grasp the world and exactly who and what Ever is fighting for - but Seleste deLaney soon lays out this world - and it is a really fun one. The Badlands lie south of the United States - ruled by a Monarchy. Ever is one of many female warriors who take the worst of the worst prisoners the US has to offer. However, most of the book takes place aboard the Dark Hawk ship and I kind of wish Badlands had been explored more.Ever is a fabulous heroine. So fierce, stubborn and smart. No time for frills or feminine behavior - she has an in your face attitude that I loved. She loves the Badlands, and her former Queen and will risk anything to deliver the princess back to her land. Although she is grateful for the help from the Dark Hawk crew, they give her more than she bargained for.The romance is not rushed and is flows really well. I love how Ever and Spencer each care about their own separate missions yet it is fun to watch the romance slowly become foremost on their minds. For a shorter book, the romance is very believable.I think there is so much to explore in the actual Badlands I hope there is another book that dives into the world. But for now, I definitely recommend this one.Rating: B",1
500,4,"I really liked the story because it involved people outside the royal family.  I wish these ideas would be in other books in series, there was an enough story to make a book.

Amarrah was a slave girl to the slave girls who fell in love with a soldier boy.  I personally would have liked to know more about them and what happened after but hopefully that will show up in the books that follow this one.This book provides a well-paced, intriguing and mystical taster into what sounds like a wonderful series to read.  This is a book of romance so it is completely safe for both young and old and all those in-between who don't want everything written out for them.",1

Bobby Autry's team is called in by Weir for help; every body get's shot up even Weir but he is considered one of Autry's team who end up saving his life along with the President, other world leaders, etc.  A fun Read, Again by Shane and it makes you think and come out of your 'La,La land'.

506,5,I got caught up in this book from the beginning and I found it hard to put down.  It has plenty of action and suspense for a zombie book.,1
507,4,"It must be so hard to write a romantic thriller these days and create a new twist in the plot! There are only so many ways a man and a woman can meet, become conflicted, solve the problem and be falling in love all at the same time. Romantic thrillers always have a past connection stalking the heroine with a view to gory death, and this novel is no exception.The characters are well rounded - I could believe Meg's terror, and found Jake's search for his past interesting - but I was confused by the explanation of why Meg was threatened with death. Without giving a spoiler, the financial shennanigans which the stalker manipulated and which led to Meg's flight, were confusing.The fast pace of the story was good for the genre.I will shortly be reading Widow's Tale, as I liked this one enough to try another of this author's work.",1
508,4,"VERY fast read. There are quite a few that I will ""steal"" and use for my own Facebook postings. The author did a good job grouping different categories together so you can sort of skip over things like certain holidays that are months away. I did notice a few repeats, but overall, if you are a constant Facebook user, it was worth the quick read.",1
509,4,"There seems to be a common thread in all the books of Bevill's that I've read so far, namely: they're character driven. The author get's inside the character and makes it so you understand more of what's going on with them in their world. The events that are happening in the book(s) are less important than the effect those events have on the characters. This is what makes this book worthwhile, as well as any book for that matter. If our protagonist doesn't understand something yet, you the reader will not either until the time is right, if the time is ever right. These little things are what make the book a cut above other books of this type that I've read.The only thing wrong with the book are the things left unanswered, which is where I guess a sequel comes in. The ending wrapped up a few things but still left many others unanswered. I was genuinely sorry I was at the end because I wanted some more.  A story like this could easily have several more books in it. Let's hope that happens.",1

515,4,"Heirs of Mars is a science fiction novel that explores a world on Mars consisting of humans, AI, and clones. The AI machines are at war with the humans even though a treaty was signed by the AI leader.  Cloner's are humans that have the ability to clone other human's minds and put them in artificial human like bodies. This technology was created to allow the humans to continue colonizing the planet despite a population decline. Dr. Asher Radescu is a geologist and a cloner and the book revolves around his trying to live after the loss of his daughter by an attack on his settlement by the AI. The author uses other characters in the book to explore the consequences of a war and cloning on a society.  The book flows smoothly for the most part and you find yourself interested in what happens to Asher.The author effectively describes a new world and makes you feel as if you were there.  He also does a good job in exploring people's decision making processes and how those decisions can affect others around them.  I would suggest this book to anyone who enjoys reading about other planets while learning a little bit about human nature.",1
516,5,I read constantly.  Typically 4-6 books a week.  I have a severe sleep disorder and reading is quiet.  This was one. Of the best books i have ever read.  It played with my emotions and was thought provoking.  I am seriously impressed!,1

518,5,"Another excellent story from Ms. Castillo-Price. I was immersed in the universe from page one, that's the kind of writing you can expect from this author. Even if it's something you've never experienced, nobody has because it doesn't even exist, you'll be there with the MCs. I guarantee it.Exceptional characters, enough psychological twists and turns to keep anyone on their toes. A study in the subtleties of our spoken language. I think I'll go back and re-read just to count the idioms and how they were applied.The sex? How about a new definition of ""first time"", yet totally believable? I get goose bumps just thinking about it...A word of advice: if you are a coffee drinker, make sure you have access to some when you start reading this book. You'll thank me for it!Highly recommended, just like all of her titles. Enjoy!",1

This is not easy for her to do after many years away from home to come home to a place that reminds her of the love she lost and may have to face again.She is shocked to find that Jascha, the man she loves still, is near death from the attack.  How can she keep her composure and remain unemotion, unattached?  As a Law Keeper it is her duty to remain unmoved and complete her mission.The dynamic between these two charachters is really good.

525,4,"I'm not usually big on anthologies, but I had a good time with that one. It was short, action packed and the stories were highly cohesive with one another. It's always a thing for me, to keep things in a coherent universe. L.A NOIRE : THE COLLECTED STORIES is about the broken soul, attracted by the seductive ghost of post-war riches in the land of perdition. Traumatized veterans, opportunistic mobsters and, of course, the broken girl. She'll always remain an object of fascination, will she?Megan Abbott and Lawrence Block wrote two powerhouses that are difficult to top, right at the start. Block's story was particularly gut wrenching, written in old-timer vernacular and all. Joyce Carol Oates' take on The Black Dahlia and Duane Swierczynski's James Ellroy insipired piece also grabbed me imagination. Andrew Vachss also closed the door in beauty with POSTWAR BOOM, the fan favorite. Los Angeles lives inside the heart of every American. That, Rockstar Games understood and got their best chronicler to give this mystifying city a proper literary treatment.",1

All the characters seemed like real people with well-developed, three-dimensional personalities whose dialogue was both authentic and fun to read. The imagery was both vivid and realistic; it was easy to immerse myself in the story. The book was very well written and there were only a few editing mistakes that really didn't interfere with reading the story. Overall, I absolutely loved this book and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read a great love story with a lot of twists and turns to help make the ending a lovely surprise.",1
528,4,"If one likes a mystery and historical fiction, this is the book for you. M. H Sargent's ""Toward Night's End"" is a well written mystery, with likable characters, an historically engaging story line, and well developed setting and local color. ""Toward Night's End"" is a complex story of murder, sedition and the internment of the more than 250 Japanese-Americans living on Bainbridge Island, near Seattle, Washington, in 1942. The greed, fear, prejudice of the government ordered internment of the Japanese-Americans is revealed through the characterization, and especially as we follow the Kobata family's trials. However, the book is not really about that; ""Toward Night's End"" is a murder mystery. It is a complex mystery that keeps you guessing as Sargent gives the reader piece after piece of puzzle without revealing too much until we get to the end. Thus, if you enjoy historical fiction and a good mystery, I strongly recommend this book to you.The story takes place in 1942 during the relocation and internment of the more than 250 Japanese-Americans living on Bainbridge Island.  The American Army lead relocation goes quite smoothly, until the Army discovers that one ""Jap"" is missing (therefore, he must be a spy). 21-year old Matthew Kobata, a fisherman, did not show up for the ferry. During their search for him, two murdered, Caucasian men are discovered on the island. Seattle detective Elroy Johnstone investigates the murders, and evidence begins to mount against Matthew. Pressure builds as this murderer -  this spy -  must be caught; meanwhile, time is passing - moment by moment - approaching the novels' climactic event ""Toward Night's End.""The title ""Toward Night's End"" holds multiple meanings, but I will leave that for each person to interpret.  The plot was developed around the historical Japanese-American internment, which does become a sub-plot of the story. From this situation, fear and prejudice surfaces from both groups, which Sargent develops a moralistic theme for us to consider. The characters are well developed, and we care about them.  Matthew, the protagonist, Johnstone, the Seattle police detective, and the Kobata family were especially well developed, and one could not help but become concerned about them as the story progressed.  A well written book, and I will look for more books by this author.",1

I was a little disappointed with the abrupt ending, but I guess Mr. Wells did it that way to make people buy the next book--which I did. I thought the story was good enough that I would want to see it through until the end, so I bought book 2 and plan on buying book 3.

534,5,"`Surrendered Hearts' by Carrie Turansky is a beautiful story of how God reveals his unconditional love and mercy through the attitudes and actions of others.Following the death of her parents, Jenn gives up on God, who could have prevented the accident that killed them. Years later, a fire rips through her apartment and her life, leaving her feeling unbeautiful, unloved, and even more lost. With only a duffel bag of belongings to call her own, she journeys to the home of her older brother, Wes(a Christian and former missionary), unsure of how she'll be received.Upon her arrival, Wes welcomes her warmly. Eager to have a relationship with his sister but concerned about the bitterness lingering in her spirit, he and his roommate Bill agree in faith to model Christ for Jenn, so that she can see Him through their lives. With prayer and patience, they hope she will form her own relationship with Jesus. However, as Bill acknowledges a growing attraction to Jenn, it becomes harder and harder to heed the still small voice inside that says, ""Don't take what isn't yours. She needs a Savior, and you are not Him.""Finding it difficult to put Jenn's spiritual needs before his earthly desires, Bill reflects on the commitment he made to God, to give his heart only to a woman who shares his faith. But the struggle to seek God's will instead of his own turns into a raging battle when Jenn's estranged fianc&eacute; materializes out of the blue, fully intending to whisk her back to Oregon and pick up where they left off. Bill is terrified of losing her forever, and unhappy with God for not opening her heart in time.Crushed with the realization that he has been seeking Jenn's salvation for his own selfish reasons, he surrenders his desires and hopes to God, trusting Him to protect her and give her the life and love she deserves. Even if that life does not include him.I recommend `Surrendered Hearts' to readers like me, who love the sad and happy tears that accompany a well-crafted story, the twists and turns of an exciting journey, and a healthy serving of food for faith.",1

537,5,"I am a big fan of Jane Austen, and reading through this book made me feel like I'm browsing through the pages of another Austen novel. There is an air of sophistication and elegance, not just in the setting of the story itself, but also in the characters that came alive in this novella. I appreciate the details of the story, especially on the very feminine aspect of tea cups, furnishings, and pastries.I enjoyed reading this story because of its aspect of reality. I liked how the friendships and relationships in this story were emphasized to be of great importance to the characters. It was obvious that Maddie and Nana's relationship is very precious to the both of them. You can see how much they adored and respected each other, and how much each person adds to the value of the other's life. You can also observe this in Maddie and Lanie's friendship, how they truly are best friends, each having the best intentions for the other.I like how romance was not central to the story, and how they entwined the characters' faith into each of their situations.  Never have I read a non-religious book that is able to include faith without it being over bearing. The subtlety of religion in this story adds to its charm of being real and down-to-earth. More often than not, we never hear or know about the main character's spirituality and beliefs, but in this story, Dianne Moody's inclusion of it only gave the characters more dimension. I highly suggest reading this story if you would want a light and fresh read - something that would definitely lift your spirits.",1

539,5,"This is one of the best indie novels I've read since buying a Kindle several years ago. I sometimes have my doubts that the whole eReader and Kindle phenomenon is good for books and reading as a whole, but then I find an excellent gem such as this and have to say THIS BOOK makes me glad I have a Kindle.Why?The answer comes in the form of the word ""GENRE"". As readers who consume book products we have become complacent with a few easy categories of books that we can choose from. If a book isn't easily categorized then it becomes ""odd"" or ""weird"". (I'm not criticizing other reviewers here as I feel the same way they do at times.) In some cases there are books that sort of ""fall between the cracks"" of genre, where you can't really tell if it is a sci-fi or a horror or a romance or whatever - and for this reason it is a bit troublesome. Then there is this book. LETHE doesn't fall between the cracks - LETHE transcends genre, in my opinion.How?First off you can't easily categorize it as there are elements of horror, drama, spirituality and so on. On the other hand it is very well written, with very distinct and interesting characters, unpredictable (yet not contrived) plot twists, and a disturbingly credible afterlife that resides so close to our own world that it somehow all makes sense. There are also underlying contemporary themes such as ""consequences of choosing to live with blind sheep-like faith versus being an iconoclast"" and ""living with the crippling isolation of a modern godless world"". Having said this - THIS IS NOT A BORING NOVEL! It definitely held my interest all the way to the end and I was sad when it was finished. This is how good novels should be, regardless of ""genre"".Anyway, please read it!",1

Frankie and Roxie's love story is not just for anyone, but those that have had similar mishaps in their journey in life to truly appreciate the attraction and love of a best friend, which is the most genuinely passionate and everlasting love imaginable.

But soon emotions and passion tangle, and Marianne wonders if it will be possible for any of them to leave this arrangement unscathed.WHAT THE MISTRESS DID is erotica at its best; sensual, alluring and inventive.  Author Anya Delvay takes readers on two journeys; Annabelle's and Marianne's.  Under Marianne's hands-on tutelage Anabelle's sexual awakening carries WHAT THE MISTRESS DID through its darker moments.  There's joy in Annabelle learning what pleases her, and the caring friendship that develops between her and Marianne was wonderful to read.  Marianne's plot - and the overarching plot of the book - is tinged with sadness.  She's in love with David but clearly recognizes that she missed her opportunity to claim the whole of him.  What made WHAT THE MISTRESS DID fascinating was watching Marianne essentially grow up over the course of the story.It's nearly impossible to write about WHAT THE MISTRESS DID without mentioning the sex scenes.  Ms. Delvay writes vast and varied erotic encounters, some between David and Marianne and even more between Annabelle and Marianne.  I love that no one holds back in WHAT THE MISTRESS DID.WHAT THE MISTRESS DID isn't a ""happy"" book, but it's ultimately a satisfying read nonetheless.  If you're in the mood for historical erotica, then WHAT THE MISTRESS DID is for you.LilyReviewed for Romance Junkies",1
544,4,"In your dreams...Meet Sara, one of the last single gals in her group of friends.  She wants a lover so badly that she can almost taste him.  After a witch's potion, her deepest desires just may come true... but at what price.  Sweet, sexy, love story.... Original & fun.  Great read.  My only complaint... it was just too short.  ;o)Keep in mind that this is an erotic fantasy.  4.5* of 5*",1
545,4,This was a TRUE Regency style novel. It was clean and an enjoyable morning read. I will look for more by this author.,1
546,5,This book lit my Kindle on fire! Loved the character development and the sexual and emotional connection that this couple make. Very sexy!,1
547,5,"This was what many women would dream of happening, enjoying the learning curve, and worrying about how it will end.  I'm going to read it again because romance should be fun without having to worry about how it will end.",1
548,5,"It was hard to put this book down.  A fairy tale love story, bad guys galore and comedy.  Amy is a genius when it comes to math and crytology.  But her life is spent running and hiding, and she doesn't know why.  Enter Prince Charming, the game programmer.  Not to give anything away, you have to read this.  It's great fun, and exciting at the same time.",1
549,4,"Just a few (aright 11) things about this lovely book.1. Why didn't I read this sooner? Why didn't I know this book even existed?! This book is what's been missing from my life.2. I'm exhausted from staying up well past my bedtime to read this.3. For real. It's probably perfect. It was for me anyway. I think this book is my soul mate.4. The characters have oodles of personality, and I wish they were real. Even the secondary ones. So I can smother them in love.5. Smoking hot smexy times reside in this book. Like WOAH. My eyes bugged out of my head during the first steam scene. In a really, really, really good way. *clears throat*6. I loved Jayden. He is endearing as hell, and worked some crazy ""how to catch yourself a player"" kung fu magic. It was epic. Kept Ryan so off kilter.7. I also loved Ryan. He is messed up. I like messed up characters that grow into slightly less messed up versions of their former selves. I did think that Ryan's growth was a little expedited at one point, but I rolled with it.8. I laughed a lot through this. I even chuckled. I don't remember the last time that happened. Jayden and Ryan's interactions are chuckle inducing.  The first half of this is pretty dang hilarious.9. Then it gets real. Angsty times reside in this book as well. I approve. Honestly, I don't think there was a lot. But I must admit that I like characters to go through some emotional trauma. It's possible I'm the kid on the playground with the magnifying glass over the ant colony.10. Back to the smexy times, I just want to say that I really liked the descriptions because they were completely lacking flowery nonsense.11. My heart is in pieces over the fact that I was prepared to devour the authors backlist when I finished this. This book is 50% of said backlist. I get so sad when that happens.12. I'm done saying stuff. You should probably go read this now.4 Stars",1
550,4,"I enjoyed this read - another good work from J.L. Merrow.  The ending had a bit of a twist which I didn't see coming - always enjoy that.  I liked the characters and the situation, and empathized with the dilemmas.  There's nothing Merrow has written that I haven't enjoyed though, so I happily admit to being prejudiced.",1
551,4,I would like more. Very interesting story with a lot of potential for a bigger novel. Damn dust gets in everything.,1
552,4,"It was a pretty good book. It was entertaining, and kept me interested. And, it sets the stage for further adventures, that would make enjoyable reading.",1
553,5,I loved this book because it could be real. The book drew me into it like I was apart of the story. Wonderful!,1
554,5,"I really enjoyed this book! It was a very exciting read, and kept me entertained throughout.Madelyn is a guardian, she protects humans from all sorts of evil things that go bump in the night. Mady is the first female guardian ever born, and is protected above all else. She's carrying hidden scars from an incident that happened three years ago. Mandy just got out of a relationship that ended bad, and is not interested in picking up another one at the moment.Brady is a full blood Lycan, and Mandy is his mate even though she's unaware of it. Brady has been watching over her, as a trusted friend. He doesn't know how to tell Mandy she's  his mate without scaring her off. Brady has been waiting for Mandy for over three hundred years, and he knows now is the time to take his chance.As I stated before this book was a exciting read. There is so much going on that you stay completely engaged throughout the book. I literally couldn't put this book down. The back story is captivating, and leave you wanting more. There were so many twist, and unexpected revelations, that I had to reread a few paragraphs just to make sure that I read it right.The secondary characters were all very interesting, and left you wanting to know what's going to happen with them in future installments of this series. There was also a lot of humor, and heart touching moments in this book. The story was action packed, and had me on the edge of my seat a few times.Brady is the perfect alpha male, with a heart of gold, and a tiny jealous streak where Mandy is concerned. Once you read this story you will understand why. I really liked his character, and was very pleased about how things developed for him in this book.Madelyn is beautiful, sassy, tough, and down to earth. She is a heroine that I definitely enjoyed reading. I liked everything about her, and couldn't find any faults with her. I loved her interaction with the secondary characters.I have to say Ms. Roth has a winner on her hands with this book. All her characters are developed enough that you have all the information that you need, and you're not left lacking or wanting. The world building was great, and I can't wait to read more. When I finished reading The Guardians at 3:00 this morning, I immediately went to search for book 2, but unfortunately it's not out yet. I did however pick up a few of her other books, and I can't wait to dive in.I have definitely added Mandy Roth to my auto- buy list. I really, truly, hope I gave this book the justice it deserves in this review. It was that good, and I want to read it over again NOW.",1
555,4,When I first found this book I thought it was a children's story. But as I read it I realized it was not. My reason is because in this story parents tell a child there is no Santa Claus. I don't personally think that is a very good idea. Also this book has a bit of suspense and there is an accident that might be too scary for children. Basically the story is about a bear that is broken and needs to be returned to the store. But instead the father decides to keep the bear. He talks to the bear all the time and realizes the bear is magical and while it doesn't talk back it is watching everything and keeping the family safe. The ending is quite good even though it took me a few minutes to get it. I'd recommend this for adults or teenagers but not for small children.~The Rebecca Review,1
556,4,"HOLY HAND GRENADES!  I feel like have just been hit by a Mack Truck.  Abduction is ...WOW...just WOW.  This book will wear you out.  I am drained.  First.  This is a looooong book.  At least 2 books worth here.  Thank you Ms Krylov for giving it to us all at once.Devon, sweet, innocent, virginal Devon is kidnapped, almost gang raped, escapes, survives plodding through the woods, going over a waterfall, finds a cabin to hide in and is found by the cabin owner who you think is going to rape her.  All in the first 5% or so of the book.  Tired yet???  Vaughn, the cabin owner is a rock star trying to escape and get some peace and quiet.  Ohhhh.  Yeah.  Enter the Alpha male, right?  Nope.  Vaughn has some serious issues of his own and I don't mean the warm fuzzy kind he can work through with the love of a good woman who just happened to show up in his cabin.  No some serious stuff has happened to Vaughn.Then you guessed it, kidnapper comes back.  Now, I do not do spoilers, but you knew that was going to happen.  When he finds them, he hold both hostage and does some *blush* REALLY DIRTY stuff to them, at them, with them, over, under, around and through.....you get the picture.In the end...which is still a Loooong way off, this is a love story about 2 or maybe 3 or dare I say 4 people who find what and who they need.  I highly recommend this if you loved Captive in The Dark and want more dark, kidnappy, stories.  Just be warned this is DARK, EROTIC and.... DOUBLE EROTIC.",1
557,5,"This is a good book to introduce and work through if you belong to a writer's club.  Most authors, already involved in the writing game however, will probably not allow their ego's to dain to another author's help.  Sadly.  I think it is a good book with good ideas for authors who have not yet reached the pinacle of success.",1
558,5,"Not having read anything by this author, I began reading this series without quite knowing what to expect. I had saved them all to read for an upcoming vacation, however, couldn't stand the temptation and began to read.... and read, I did! Once I started, I could not stop - from one book to the other. I do not tell details when I write my reviews or spoil the reading for the reader. What I will say is this:This is a refreshingly written series of the Highlander Clans in Scotland. Each book has approximatly three sets of characters it focuses on, yet still interweaves others from past groups into the next. It slowly progresses through three generations. I could have kept on reading!I enjoyed the way this author mixed the characters and the love stories. I enjoyed the fact that romance & love could be found without embarassing details. I also, liked how each title had a number in the series on it, making it easy to follow from one to the next.Although not a major literary piece, this group of books is thoroughly enjoyable and  filled with intersting details of the time period. For this reason, I have given them ALL a five star rating!",1
559,5,"I just can't wait to read the next book!  So much fear, suspense, wondering who was good or bad. Would her friends survive or not.",1
560,4,"""Effie At The Wedding"" by Tracy Marchini is a very sweet short story of a teenage girl named Effie who is at her older sister, Ophelia's wedding.  Effie has all the common teenage ""angst"" you find in todays young people.  She lives with her family who appear to be consumed with her weight and seem over-critical of her.  Effie fears that her sisters' wedding will be the end of her special sister/best friend relationship.  Effie is witty and charming, sensitive, and intuitive.  I love when she locks herself in the bathroom to avoid the family.  Her list-making reminds me of myself as a teenager.I would definitely recommend this short and sweet story to any girls who would like a light read that will make you smile.I won this book from LibraryThing. I was not required to give a positive review.",1

She has no fear when flying and doesnt think twice about doing risky moves to stop the bad guys.But she also is obsessed with finding her twin brother's killer. This leads her to a bar where she thinks she is meeting an informant that is going to give her the name of her brothers killer.Rico Cortes is a deep undercover DEA agent. He has been trying to bring down the biggest Miami drug lord for years. When he finds out that Olivia is messing up his investigation he goes to the bar to try and get her to back off. But these two are instantly attracted to each other and spend the night burning up the sheets.When a drug bust goes south and Rico is recovered from the boat that blew up Olivia finds out who he really is and now that his cover is blown the two take off on the run.Once I got into the book I realized that Olivia was bordering more on the Alpha character of the book than Rico was. I like strong women characters but it was a little weird.Rico realizes that Olivia isnt going to back off and he agrees to help her go undercover to try and bring down the drug lord who is also her brother's murderer.There are lots of twist and turns in the book that lead up to a final showdown that leaves the best woman standing.,1

566,4,"Steamside Chronicles was a little bit of a lot of things: a bit of 'time travel', a bit of steampunk, and a bit of romance.Police officer Emily (Fen) Fenwick suddenly finds herself part of a group of individuals who have been pulled from the modern world and who now split their time between 1890's New York and the otherworldly dimension of Steamside where they must guard their fortress from physical manifestations of Nightmares. A relationship develops between Emily and Jack, who is 'the Man' in charge of the ragtag group of displaced-in-time 'punks' who make Steamside their home.  But since both leads are somewhat of a mess due to their circumstances - the heroine being weepy as a result of the trauma of being torn from her normal life and the hero, suffering from insecurity as a leader who has no hope of bringing his people back home - there are moments when the relationship seems more suited to a YA story, despite some more adult intimacy that occurs between the pair.Adding to my occasional confusion, the story is told from the first person point of view but switches back and forth between two narrators: Fen, and Jack.  I don't have problems with first person narrations per say, but the switches weren't always obvious and it often took a sentence or two to determine whose head we were in. My favorite part of the book though were the supporting characters, Petti the hero's sister, Screw the inventor and Sweet Pea who is in charge of guarding Steamside were all intriguing.Over all I liked Steamside Chronicles, it is a bit off-beat and surreal at times but I found that interesting.",1
567,5,I don't even know what to say. I just loved this trilogy. These guys are masters of their profession. Fabulous stories and extremely well written!!! I will buy anything these guys write.,1
568,4,"Lila Dubois has some kind of wicked imagination when it comes to ice in the bedroom!I liked this book better than then second one in the series.  I thought the characters of Runako and Margo were well drawn.  Getting a sense for Runako's pain at his sister's tortured death at a research facility and the internal dialogue for how he feels about Margo when he has all reason to hate humans makes it a book well worth reading.  Margo's sassiness really comes across, but her finally getting over her self esteem issues made me cheer.What made this book much better for me is that it takes place in the monsters' home in the mountains, and more than just the three main men in the books, you meet others and get to witness how they live, how they mourn, and even how they love.  Hot and fun, it brought me in better than the second book did, and while the first may remain my favorite, I really want to read Henry's story next and hope the author is working on it right now!",1

570,5,"Erosa Knowles knows how to tell a story. The Ultimate Breed drew me in from the beginning. I loved how she twisted the story of where and how vampires originated.Vampire breeder, Skye--yes, they give live birth and aren't made by biting people--is on the run, from hunters and her own people. Someone's out to kill her, preferably before her son is born.Her Were-hyena bodyguard calls in help, his good buddy Adrian Vail. Ah, Adrian, just the name is hot and brings back memories of Highlander. This alpha has some shocks in store for him, and I can't say more without ruining the story.Ms. Knowles ratchets up the action and tension--sexual and emotional--on every page. She uses humor to defuse situations, then starts again. I'm hoping the second book in the series comes out soon. Did I mention that I'm not patient?",1
571,5,"Not knowing who is after her and fearing for her safety, Mariella seeks help from her handsome neighbor.  This was a quick and enjoyable short story that satisfied my reading pleasure by giving me both a mystery to solve and a little bit of romance.",1
572,4,"Skye is a newly made vampire on the run for her life. She has been groomed for vampirism since birth; but after being changed at age 21, she developed an unexpected gift, trusted the wrong person with a very big secret and inadvertently placed herself in the line of fire.She finds herself in the charming city of Louisville, where she can't help but make a life for herself - friends, a job she loves, a nice apartment... But after a short time of peace, danger finds her once more, and she is faced with a big decision - keep running forever and give up a chance at any sort of happy life, or stop running and confront her enemy, risking death? Being torn between two very sexy men is the very least of her problems.What a great first effort. Skye is tough, caring, and likeable, the cast of supporting characters is colorful and fun, and the action never stops. The book ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, so I'm assuming this is the first in a series - Ms Litteral, please do keep writing. :)",1
573,5,"I loved Dani, Rowe and Justin. Some may say Justin was a jerk, but I think the author did a great job showing that he was exactly what Dani and Rowe needed. Very sexy stuff.",1
574,5,"Who knew community service could be so...sexy?When I want a story that's hot, emotional, and satisfying, there is one author I always turn to. K.A. Mitchell. I know when I open a K.A. Mitchell story, I'm sure to squirm in my seat and root for the HEA. This book was no exception. The story flowed effortlessly from page to page, reeling me in and not letting up until the end. In fact, I found myself thinking about Cade and Elliot later when doing my own chores. But don't get me wrong, thinking about them aside, there were parts that drove me crazy and got under my skin. To me, an emotional attachment is the mark of a great story. This one fit the bill.Cade is a piece of pierced work. He's not about to conform to any standards except the lack of standards. His need to be his own man was endearing. What I loved about him was his fallibility. He's been through a bad relationship and bears the scars, but he's still breathing, still going about his life. I had to hand it to him. Many people would crack, especially after the circumstances he'd lived with, but he didn't.Elliot is the character I wanted to cuddle. Seriously. Handsome, yes. Young, sure. But in his own way, he'd lived through odd circumstances. I wanted to know a bit more about his back story and his foiled attempts at relationships, but given the length of the story, I still enjoyed learning about him. His strength was what drew me to him. He appeared fragile at times, but it merely masked his true devotion to Cade. Great stuff.I can't leave out the love scenes. Ms. Mitchell writes carefully constructed love scenes that never fail to warrant a chilled drink and the need to hunt down that special person. I felt the love and lust between Cade and Elliot when even they weren't sure the experience was more than just sex. The scene in the backseat of ""Bucky"" the Plymouth had me reading and rereading just to savor the experience.If you want a book that's sure to make you blush for the best reasons, you need to read Hot Ticket. I give this book 4.5 cherries.Originally posted at Whipped Cream Reviews",1
575,4,"Deep, intense sometimes too much intensity actually. Good story with our little thief and her bag of tricks. Dragged a bit getting mired in the need for plot expansion and explanation, but overall a good read that kept me in it til the end. Maybe a bit superfluous for my liking, kind of like this review.

576,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed this ebook. In the vein of Hitchhiker's guide, it doesn't take itself too seriously. I recommend it if you want to be entertained by a fast-paced sci fi tech novel with engaging characters. I will definitely buy other books by Daniels.",1

But on his first trip overseas, he had to have an extension!  If it was a bad omen, he didn't let it spoil his trip.  A week split between London, Paris  and Rome doesn't allow for in-depth exploring, but they hit a few well-known attractions and had some interesting meals.  No travel tips or deep introspection here, just some observations and a few laughs.",1

581,5,"The storyline takes center stage in this romance.  The world building and plot are the main focus of thie romance.  Within the plot worthy of a science fiction genre is the romance aspect.  Both characters are strong, self-confident people and tend to avoid the wallowing in self-pity that can be found in countless other romances.  The main character, Xenos is a tortured soul hero and the reader delights in following his personal growth throughout the storyline.  The heroine, Moonlight, is just as strong as the hero.  She keeps up with him and doesn;t take any shit, which I might add is very refeshing.  This book went into my favorite collection and will be re-read in the future.",1

585,5,"This is not Twilight. This is a real head-on scary werewolf story. These wolves are not to be pet, hugged or kissed - they are to be run from shrieking in terror, and you can not imagine how either of the MC's will make it out of the basement alive. The fact that there is a romance between the two men is probably their only hope of surviving - for one of them, at least.The villains? You literally want to rip through your Kindle and inflict fatal bodily harm upon them.The sex scene is not graphic, It's quite mild actually, and can even be skipped over without losing the plot, if that's what some prefer.I didn't know what to expect from this book when I picked it up. I just knew it was about werewolves. Boy, am I glad I bought this one. Definitely on the upper level of the werewolf spectrum.",1
586,5,"I really liked this story.  It was whimsical and somehow soothing. I perceived the story to be about safety, about having a guardian, perhaps a guardian angel of sorts. A supernatural gardian angel.Children sometimes see their stuffed animals as protectors. When afraid of the dark or a new situation, out come the stuffed animals as protection. This story takes that to another level. I would love to have a ""Benny"" for my children. I can still remember my favorite teddy bear from childhood. Maybe that is why this story felt comforting to me.That said, this story would not be appropriate for young children. There are Santa issues, and there are a few scenes that would probably be scary to young children. It really is a shame, because the story message itself would be great for kids. The message is that someone or something is always looking out for you, even when you don't see it. This one is going into my keeper folder.",1
587,4,"I gave this book 3.5 stars but rounded it to 4 for a few reasons. First it was FREE (Thanks Amazon) and I couldn't put the book down. It definitely kept my interest. Read it in just 1 day.Holy Twilight Batman!!As I read more and more of this book I realized how similar the two story lines are. But I actually liked the characters and story of this book so much better! The connection William has to Bryn is like no other story I have read before. When he reveals his secret about her, actually his sister in-law Cora does (and I LOVE HER by the way). It made me melt and wish I had a guy wanting me for over 200 years!I could not put this book down, I kept wanting to know what would happen next between all the characters. I really liked the two lead characters and I adored Patrick and Cora... what wonderful future (possibly) brother & sister in law they will be.A few negatives is I found some of the scenes hard to follow. Similar to Twilight I just think with all the science fiction aspect of the stories it can be hard to picture in your head and understand the meaning of the words on the pages of the book. It took me the movie to understand all of Twilight so I don't blame the writing. I also kind of got annoyed with Bryn thinking she was dull and boring, when obviously her 5'10 self is not with all the guys wanting her everywhere she goes. I also was getting annoyed with the constant ""I LOVE YOU's"" from the characters yet William constantly kept secrets from her, she would find out and not care very much he wouldn't tell her the truth even when it affected her greatly. I would be upset if my boyfriend was hiding things from me when it had to do with my life and future.I did enjoy this book to my surprise. I have started book 2 and will continue the series and on to the Patrick's own books. I can't wait to find out what happens next![...]",1

590,5,"Maylea ""May"" Aiona has wanted Evan Chambers for a long time. But he's only ever treated her like a kid sister. Added to her depressed mood is the acknowledgment that all her previous sexual experiences have left her less than fulfilled. After chatting with a close friend, May opts to explore her submissive desires at a BDSM club. Good thing her friend has connections, and soon she's agreed to a public submission at the club in exchange for the hefty fee the club requires for membership.Evan's wanted May since he first laid eyes on her, but feels she's out of his league so he never attempts to make her his.  Then she arrives at the BDSM club where he's a silent partner and becomes the Dom to her sub during her public submission. He's enthralled by her beauty and her feistiness and wants to be her Dom in her life beyond the club. He's already more possessive of her than he has any right to be. But then he learns of the threatening letters and messages left for her and his rage knows know bounds. While May tries to make light of the messages, claiming she's not in any danger, Evan knows better and will do what it takes to keep his submissive safe.Author Melissa Schroeder is quickly becoming a must-read writer for me. Her stories never fail to entertain and arouse and A Little Harmless Obsession is no exception. May and Evan have a decent friendship already under their belts. Quietly but impatiently simmering in the background is their attraction for one another. This makes for the best foundation of their relationship, because they already know quite a bit about each other, and yet, it was a delight to read their surprise when their mutual attraction was brought to light. The sexual tension between this couple was heady and there were times I wanted to toss the two of them in bed just to give them some relief! But those times where they did give in to their desires were three-alarm-fire smoking!The added suspense of the stalker element was just the right touch for this story and it sped up the action to a rapid staccato. There were times that Evan's frustrations - his self loathing regarding his past, his anger at not being able to control May when she chose to exercise her own independence or her desire for space - made me want to choke him at times. But when he began revealing his inner vulnerability, it thoroughly endeared him to me, not only as a Dom but also as a man. May's inner strength was admirable and I can only strive to be someone like her.

591,5,"Personally, I felt this book was going to be a cookie-cutter ""mystery"" (not really a mystery but you'll see what I mean when you read it) where everything wraps up quick in the end. Needless to say, I was so surprised when the plot took unbelievable twists and turns that on more then one occasion I gasped aloud! The characters have true depth, real life issues, while at the same time keeping their goofy British humor and compassion at the forefront. I did NOT have high hopes when I first delved into this book but, boy, am I glad I found it! Read it! You'll be glad you did. I'm going to find the rest of the author's work now...",1
592,4,"I wish that Amazon let us do reviews in increments of half-stars.  This is much more of a three and a half star book.It is reasonably well written.  The dialogue in the beginning makes some rookie mistakes.  The characters grin and smile too much when they speak.  It seemed like the author was looking in his thesaurus for different words so that he would have to use the verb ""say.""  However, the dialogue does get better as the book progresses.  And at least what the characters say is said well enough.  It's never great, but it's fine.People have compared this author to Eddings, and to Tolkien.  There is a reason for that.  The hero, young Garion, quickly meets up with an old man visited him often as a youth - we'll call him BelGandalf, and his manservant who only appears to be a mute, Aragorn.  In Rivendell - I mean, Luxlor, a party is formed, including Silk, the Elven Master of Spies, and Garion's cousin, the Elven Prince Legolas.  We quickly find out that the Dark Lord SauronTorakAmird is out to get him, because he is the lost heir to the throne of RivArnor.  This is of course kept hidden from Garion . . .Yeah.  It's derivative and not as imaginative as I would like.In all fairness, most fantasy is derivative.  There are only so many tropes, and let's face it - Tolkien casts such a shadow over the genre that it's hard to avoid even where an author tries.  Nevertheless, it can still be done well even if it is derivative, and this book isn't done as well as I would like.This book lacks the depth and feel of Tolkien.  It also lacks the spark and humor of Edding's Belgariad.  Fortunately, it also lacks the terrible humor of Edding's later work.I give this four stars, not because I really liked it - it was okay - but because outside of the dialogue problems in the beginning, it's good enough.  No major editing errors, the dialogue is okay, it's got some polish, the voice that the author uses isn't annoying - nothing particularly wrong in this book.  But there isn't much that stands out, either.It's a bland, generic epic.  I liked it just enough - and it got better sufficiently - that I'm seriously considering buying the sequels.",1
593,4,"This book really is a funny and cute read, however as it neared the end I was left feeling like it stopped before it was done. This whole book takes place in one single evening a lacks detail for some of the characters.  Felt like it had a great start, was just hoping there was more of it.",1
594,4,"This curiosity of a book was written in the early 1900s. A sparkly bit of fluff, the story takes place during the downfall of the British aristocracy in the time when large estates became a financial drain and could not support the old lifestyle. And yet, thanks to a mind-set developed over centuries, ""gentlemen"" distained working as an option.This comedy of manners shows what happens when a young housemaid inherits a fortune and hires her young, penniless former mistress as her maid. Madness ensues as the ""maid"" tries to polish her new mistress and help her navigate the potential disasters awaiting her in society and among fortune hunters.Since this is a comedy of manners, stereotypes are used liberally. Some, like the handsome, sweet-talking, duplicitous Irishman fit into the story.Others, like the villain--an oily, mean-spirited foreign Jew--make modern readers cringe.It is best to keep in mind that this book comes from an earlier age with all the prejudices of that age.It also helps to remember that the setting is around the time of World War I when a swastika was merely an ancient good luck symbol.",1

Go ahead and grab this one but make sure you either have everything else done or can do without getting it done.Point of View: You follow Tyler throughout this suspense ridden storyline.Voice: Does a great job of compelling the reader forward.Character Development: Expertly crafted and spot on. The characters become a part of the reader and as the reader you will be caught up in it all.Plot: Crafted to precision and will have you on the edge of your seat.Dialogue: Genuine dialogue that only reinforces the development of the characters.Pacing: Short quick chapters and written in a way that makes the story breeze by.Setting: The scary part is this could all be true, glad to know for now it is all in the pages of this book.Continuity: Does not miss a beat and the writing allows the reader to move through the story without effort.",1
599,5,"Two warring countries, two young princes honor-bound to protect their people, two proud leaders who refuse to back down.  These are the countries of Rezzia and Pawelon.  Rezzia is a country of people who worship the ten gods of the Lux Lucis; Pawelon is a country of sages and thinkers who utilize their own minds to reach a higher level of consciousness.  Rezzia believes they must conquer Pawelon in order to raise its people above their superstitions; Pawelon believes they must stand fast against the mythology of the Rezzians.  Can there be any end to this conflict without the multitude of deaths feared by the Rezzian Haizzam, Caio, or the Pawelon prince Rao?  Can they find a way to work together to achieve peace, or will their fathers ensure that there will be nothing but war?It was very difficult to come up with a way to describe the overall plot of this story without a) getting into way too many details and/or b) adding in too many spoilers.  This is a very complex story, with multiple layers and ideologies.  Siregar says he wrote the story as an homage to Homer; there are also references that can be related to Greek and Roman mythologies and ideologies and a strange blend of Hinduism and Buddhism.  I found it all quite fascinating, although many I have spoken to have had a difficult time with the story due to its very density.  Personally, I really liked it.  It is definitely dark fantasy - deep and heavy - but if you are a fan of military fantasy, dark fantasy, and/or stories that delve into the relationships between people and gods, you should find this as fascinating a read as I did.  This is the first book in a series, and the author says that he is working on the second book at this time.  Be sure to check this most interesting story out - if you enjoy a complex read, you will love this.",1
600,5,"I picked out this book today from the ""free Kindle top 100 books"" and although the initial lack of information about the book (non existent description and no reviews)tended to put me off, I decided to give it a try.  Man, am I glad I did!!!  This book captivated me in a way few books do.  At first the writing style (reminiscent of Kent Haruf, author of Plainsong, Eventide, et al.) was unexpected.  This style includes run on sentences, unusual beginnings and endings to paragraphs and a choppy, almost machine gun like dialogue which, until you get used to it, can be a little off putting, yet...  like Haruf's novels it works its magic and is so believable it's as if you are a ghost hovering around the author, living alongside him and his shipmates as he spins this great tale.Set on-board a navy fighting ship just prior to the first Gulf War, and in Iraq for a time during the Gulf War, the book is not a long read yet its ability to insert you directly into the middle of the action is amazing.  You really get an incredible insight into the lives of Sailors and Marines on-board ship as they move through their sometimes mundane, or exciting, or tragic daily lives. The harsh reality of life and death as an inescapable fact of war is realistically portrayed, as are the thoughts and/or actions which might preserve life or cause death in a given situation.The language used is strong yet exactly as men talk to one another under conditions of camaraderie, or lack thereof, in the close quarters of shipboard life during times of peace or war.This is not so much a story as it is a narrative and, as such, there is no real plot or storyline.  Instead, you find rich  dialogue and intimate thoughts placed on the pages in a manner which draws you into the situations and assures your undivided attention.If you are looking for a realistic book about the thoughts and feelings of realistic characters, then this book should fill the bill, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who wants a Damn Good read.",1
601,4,First I have to say that having read up on the creation of this book I am doubly blessed to be a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints which would make something like this available for $3.99. However I did find that Joshua 24 is misnumbered as 23.1 etc under the heading of Chapter 24.,1
602,4,"This is a delightful Christmas love story, well written, witty and a pleasure to read.

For a fast paced and enjoyable read this is a great book.",1
603,4,"I love of a good serial killer novel as much as the next guy, but Blake Crouch really hits on the finer points in this series.",1
604,4,"Plot/Storyline: 4 StarsThis book opened with a scene that pulled me into the novel, making me want to know what happened next. I didn't have to wait long as each section, which told of a portion of Johnny Buck's life, while leaving the reader hanging for more, still had a feeling of completeness.The overall plot was intriguing and original. The storyline did get a little long-winded at times, with about thirty percent of the book being unnecessary to the plot. I do prefer my novels to be a little more tightly written and with a faster pace. There were just too many scenes that did not contribute to the storyline.I found the conclusion to be completely unpredictable and satisfying, if a little corny. I liked the way the author did not add a lot of explanation to drag out the ending.There was a rather drawn-out sex scene in the middle of the book. When reading it, I really thought it was superfluous. However, the inclusion of it was explained in the ending, so it definitely fit.Character Development: 4 StarsI found Johnny to be a normal kid, if not particularly likable, in the first section. As he got older, I found myself liking him less and less. He just seemed like a jerk for the most part. However, by the end, I was rooting for him, at least a little, as some sympathy was generated. He also grew quite a bit as a character.Most of the other characters were one-dimensional, without any real personalities.Writing Style: 4 1/4 StarsThe writing style was excellent with good voice and sentence structure.  The descriptions were vivid and well written. The dialogue for the ""young Johnny"" was a little mature for the age group; however, the rest of the book had good dialogue.I found it odd that a very few chapters were thrown in that told the story from different viewpoints. It seemed like the entire book should have been from Johnny's point of view or have had more chapters told from various viewpoints. Those few chapters threw the book off course for short periods.Editing/Formatting: 5 StarsBoth were of professional quality.Rating: R for Sex, Language, Mild Violence",1

It is a sweet romance and filled with Caelyn's trials and tribulations as she deals with heart disease and facing death.  Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  Caelyn's situation is a bit terrifying, a lot for a young girl to go through, yet she soldiers on.  I don't want to give too many details away, I just suggest you read it for yourself!~M. L.

607,5,"I bought A Woman's Place the first day it was released. I finished reading it a couple of days ago. This book is a fascinating read.  Knowing that the story is based on the author's ancestors made the book even more interesting to me. I became so involved with this story. I laughed and I cried with Julia and Sonja. By the time I reached the last page, I felt as though Julia and Sonja were part of my own family.Susanne O'Leary is a masterful story teller. I highly recommend this book. I sincerely hope Susanne writes a sequel to A Woman's Place. I MUST know what happened with Sonja after this book's end.Kristie Leigh MaguireSecond Chancesand other titles",1

610,5,"I'm finding in my readings of Harper Fox's that I truly lack the literary language to accurately express how incredible the book is. I only have so many adjectives and I'm running out of them as descriptors.The Salisbury Key is intense. It describes so many life lessons such as grief, love, hate, anger, fear, jealousy and happiness.Truly a work to be read. You'll enjoy it. You'll see.",1
611,4,"I received a complimentary copy of this book in order to review it. I found the book interesting and hard to put down once I started reading it.  I did find following what was going on somewhat difficult especially mid way through the book when a significant event occurs.  The main character's inner conflict which is how to deal with her past and reconcile it with her present is compelling and interesting, and makes the reader wonder what they would do if they were presented with similar choices.My only complaint which is why I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is because the book doesn't really have an ending.  While I understand that there is a sequel to it, I would have liked the first book to have had its own conclusion, as most books in a series do.",1

With some Indiana Jones type action, some creepy bad guys, some hot and strange love scenes (sex in a tree!), this story keeps your interest all the way through to the end.  Treasure Hunting is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Vivian",1
613,4,"Worth the read. Psychothriller with a twist. Imagine the torture of being taken away from the ones you love and trust, add to that the pain of knowing you need to protect not only yourself. That's what this book delivers. Fall in love with the bad guy at the same time you're rooting for the good guys. The thing with this book is that what happens is very much non-fiction; there are no out of this world action scenes.The reader is drawn into the life of the psychotic killer; you'll find yourself liking him despite your common sense. His past was hell and he hungers for the kill; but he finds himself wanting a quiet life with the girl he mistakenly takes in a drunken furry. The girl's strength throughout the book, outshines even Wonder Woman. The mobsters act exactly as I would imagine. The cop was the a bit of a disappointment in my opinion. I found him too weak, uncreative and not too bright. His detective skills were lacking to say the least.All in all a highly entertaining read. It does grab the reader and for someone with a busy schedule...well, get ready, the world will just have to wait.",1

615,4,"This is a well-written and conceptualized story. It's creative and I really enjoyed the characters. The one flaw is the vampire was not ""revealed"" enough. I just didn't get a ""sense"" of him. I'm guessing the author will evolve him more in subsequent books (which I'll buy).

617,5,"I am so glad I stumbled upon this little Gem!Kris is a refreshingly stable character and has great support around her in the way of two friends she has had with her since college, Roni and Cassie. Though Kris has a little quirk, she is a Precognitive, she sees flashes of the future which may, or may not depending on decisions made, happen with days or weeks of her seeing it. I was very glad the writer did not hang on this detail, it was written in to the book as if it were completely normal. It is a natural ability she was born with.Kris has quite an idealistic life, she lives by the beach, owns a company that, with the help of Roni's herbal inventions, is growing. She is a very beautiful woman and it is this fact that catches the attention of a stalker who we learn much about and is a very bad piece of work. He creeped me out, that was for sure.The book follows Kris as she tries to deal with knowing she is being watched, recieving creepy phone calls and having quick visions of the future that puts her friends in danger and Nick, the man she fell for in college and is re-untied with a quarter way through the book.What I liked most about this book was it was not overly dramatic. Kris is mentally and emotionally strong and copes with the situation very well. I also loved the understated romance with Nick, the evil stalker and the supporting characters such as Dylan and Jerry. They all added great personalities to the story and hope we hear more from them throughout the trilogy.My only problem was the abrupt ending. It had lent it self to a climax that could have been chilling, painful and incredibly suspensful. I felt it ended too soon and I would have liked to have seen more of a struggle there.I cant wait to read the second book in the series. Great book!",1
618,5,"Wow, here is another book I am struggling to review. Not in a bad way. No, I absolutely loved this book! I don't personally come from a military family. My uncle was in the navy for 25 years before retiring to be a school teacher and my father, grandfather and other older members were in various parts of the military. But all were out of their military careers by the time I came around. I whole heartedly support our troops no matter how I feel about the government or the wars we are in. It is basic every day men and women who protect us. Give us our freedoms. And allow me to voice my opinion on romance books I adore. Thank you.That out of the way, let's not totally confuse this as  a military themed book where there are explosions on every page. There is some action, but the majority of the book takes place after Sergeant First Class Shane Garrison is injured and sent home to recover. I am getting a little ahead of myself in this review...backtracking.We meet Shane as he is signing the divorce papers. Kind of sad and just ready for it to be over. He's ready to deploy with his men, but there is one problem. He had emergency appendix surgery and has been hiding it from everyone. You have to be in tip top shape to deploy and Shane obviously isn't ready. The night before his deployment he is talked into going out with the guys, where he meets Jen St. James, a nurse. There is instant attraction, some kisses, but they both know it can't go much further and say their goodbyes. Here comes the next day and Jen's the nurse who has to clear Shane for deployment. Yep, she finds out about his surgery and due to a lot of pleading from Shane, sends him off to Iraq.We don't hear much any more about the surgery. No problems arise on either side for having forged ahead when they both know they shouldn't have. I guess I expected some ramifications for this, but they never developed.While out on a mission, Shane and two other men under his command get severely injured and sent back home. That is the basic story, but there is also some underlying story of stealing and that is coming to blame on these three men. An investigation is taking place by a guy I wanted to punch often, while the other two men are learning to live without limbs and Shane is trying to recover from having his legs shattered and pieced back together. The emotion this guy invoked out of me left me wanting to cram his clipboard down his throat.I focused a lot of Shane there, but Jen has a very big change in her life. She had cancer at one time and had a breast removed. The angry scar seems to mock her most of the book. So while the men think she can never understand their loss and pain, she has a very unique look at it. Can I hug Shane right now? Yes, Shane. Her not having a breast was not a big deal to him. He loved her for her and not what body parts were missing. I wanted to jump up and down for man who could accept her for herself and not the scar staring him in the eye!The book is mostly about healing both physically and mentally from wounds, be they from war or disease. The responsibility we feel for those around us can shape the person we feel we are and color how we should react. There are deep emotions on what you should be responsible for and what you are actually responsible for. Emotions run wild over physical therapy, returning to war, the lose of a limb and even attempted suicide.It is hard to explain why I felt so deeply for this book. It is steamy with several love scenes, but that wasn't what made it a keep for me. I guess one way to explain it is that Jessica took the time to get to know the characters. She developed them and we grew with them. Just because they had attraction, she didn't just throw them into bed together. They had issues to over come before they could come together.On top of that there were a lot of wonderful supporting characters. I can't wait to see what happens to Trent and Laura. That one is breaking my heart. Then there is Vic and Nicole. Wondering if they will show up in any more stories as I loved Vic Carponti's sense of humor even if I did want to slap him upside the back of the head like Gibbs does.I gobbled this book up in one day and wanted to continue reading it. It was a heart wrenching look into what happens when you lose a part of yourself and how you learn to cope and move on after the dirt settles.",1

622,4,"A good short story for a reasonable price. Other reviewers have provided the story line, I'd add that I liked McTark's inventiveness in the sex scenes, with a tinge of exhibitionism. Good chemistry between Brian and Amber, their characters had enough depth to make me care about them. The misunderstanding between them was a little out of character for Brian, but you gotta have some angst tension for a good story. I could have used a little more background on Brian. How is a nice, hot, hunky, hung guy like Brian not married or at least involved?",1

On occasion, I might supplement this by looking at the online edition (if I MUST see a color picture, or something).  The online editions can be hard to read, and are best for a glance - I have it on an iPod Touch - nice to have, but not exactly my idea of a desired reading experience like Kindle.Like clockwork, the paper arrives early each morning (no more missed papers), easy to search headlines and a nice compliment to the online edition, in a great reading format.Well done!",1

I didn&#8217;t think it was possible for Volume II to be better than Volume I - &#8220;House of Skin&#8221;, but I think I enjoyed this second instalment even more. The short-story is a format which I usually find unsatisfying, but not when in the hand of this author. Every story is perfectly self-contained and every character is meticulously drawn and well-rounded: yes, all the stories are told from the point of view of female protagonists, but their appeal is universal, and I defy the reader not to be sucked in immediately from &#8216;Assassin Orders Peking Duck&#8217;, centred around the Bali bombing, or not to be intrigued and simultaneously repulsed by the fictionalised life of Paul Gauguin in &#8220;Cannibal Nights, Colonial Afternoons&#8221;. I will not spoilt it for you - see for yourself.But I warn you: after finishing this volume, I immediately purchased and read the third one, &#8220;Opium Dreams&#8221;: this is what Kiana Davenport&#8217;s writing does to you - it&#8217;s beautifully addictive.",1

He honestly feels no remorse in his pining and only wishes for an opportunity to see the object of his affection again. That opportunity arises when he receives news that the King of Connacht, Mara's father is on his deathbed and wishes to see his only daughter before he passes on. The King has asked that Breandan escort his daughter from Inis Mor to him.Mara lives in the Isle of Inis Mor with the product of her short but timeless love affair with Daegan, their son Lochlann.

633,5,"If you have read any of my other reviews you know that I am a tough critic. I am especially tough on whiny, spoiled heroines. You won't find any of those creatures anywhere in this story. Kathy Lee is smart, decent, vulnerable, kind, funny, loving, high spirited and yet unsure of herself. In particular, I appreciated the fact that, while alluded to, very little time was spent on the physical beauty of Kathy Lee and Robert. Due to this wise choice by the author, the beauty of their spirits was allowed to carry us away.I can't say enough about this book. The repartee between the main characters was stellar (is anything more exhilarating than the growing, unfolding love of a pair of incurable smart alecks?), the plot was well constructed, the pacing perfect and the setting irresistible. I wish I could read ten more stories just like it. I come from a family of historians, the Revolutionary period being our particular niche and the research was quite thorough. Rare is the occasion that I am motivated to give five stars and this is one of those times. Be warned, if you are looking for steamy sex scenes you will not find them in this book but the love story is so expertly handled you will be smitten with Robert Upton before all is said and done. Otherwise, I hold out no hope for you whatsoever.",1
634,4,"I enjoyed this tale, as the indestructible heroine battles a relentless succession of (unlikely) life-threatening scenarios.An element that I did find rather disconcerting was the author's penchant to mix the dispassionate tense of the narrative of what was happening with actual conversations.As an integral component of the tale, the reader will learn a lot about contemporary Africa and will become more knowledgeable about the challenges facing that troubled continent.It's also an -almost- believable story....enjoy!",1
635,4,"Winter's Kiss by F. E. Heaton is about forbidden love between a Vampire and a Werewolf.  Winter is a Vampire who has loved Nika from afar for years.  When she is attacked and bitten by a werewolf he knows that his dreams of being with her are over.  It is against Vampire law for him to be with a Werewolf, the penalty is death.  Winter is determined to protect Nika; he just doesn't know how he'll be able to walk away from her when he's done.  Nika plans to do everything in her power to stop Winter from walking away from her.  Will she succeed?  Will these two find a way to be together?This is an emotional story filled with love and turmoil.  It is sad at times and joyful at others.  You want them to stay together but you don't know how that is possible.  You ache for them.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to find out what happens next.  When a book has the power to move you then you know it's a good one.  This is a great book by a talented author.  I would recommend it to any one who enjoys Paranormal Romance.",1
636,4,I bought and read this book the same day as the first.  Lots of action and the plot moved forward.  Some secrets were revealed and others foreshadowed.  Was thrilled to see the third book just published so I could read more.,1

She can't even sleep without someone haunting her in her dreams!Midnight Hunter is beautifully written! The characters are full, with no details missing, the history of Vampires and the ""Underworld"" explained, and the plot grows and matures throughout the book!

640,4,"This book and it's sequel are well worth reading.  The story is exciting and unpredictable.  The main character is humanly flawed, but driven to succeed, for Earth's survival. I found myself wondering how he could possibly get out of the impossible situation he was up against this time.  Very enjoyable book.",1
641,4,"The 7th novel sees Sabre and Tassin back home and continues the story quite well.  I have to say, the ending surprised me so I highly recommend getting to this point if you have been reading along.",1
642,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed the 1st of the series but this one was even better! I could not put the book down. I cried, laughed, got excited, and often stopped to ponder on the story and how it related to my own experiences. I was inspired by the characters. I feel like they're friends, like I really know them! that is exactly how one should feel when reading a book. And for anyone who says that the series are too fake and not realistic, I must strongly disagree. I grew up in a broken home, I know the pain of losing twin boys shortly after birth, I married my High School sweetheart who was unfaithful and left me 6yrs into the marriage after just having a baby, but I also know how amazing Jesus is and how far his love will go to reach us, forgive us and restore us. He truly restores onto us all that the locust hath eaten away. I am now married to a wonderful gentleman, a man after God's own heart, who truly loves me and my son and who still opens the door for me. I have experienced true emotional as well as physical healing. I now have a new baby, a complete family, restored health and relationships. Life will always have challenges and disappointments but there really is an indescribable peace that only Jesus can bring. Miracles still occur, relationships can be restore and healing is real. This book took me back to my own Jesus tree (my alone place with Him) and brought me back to my 1st love. I have truly been blessed and encouraged by this book.",1

644,4,"The first book in a series, 'Alone' follows the life of Erin Rose, a 22-year-old woman who wakes one morning to find that she has no memories of her past and no knowledge of who she is. The only clue she has to work with is a vampire bite on her neck. She is determined to find answers about her old life and what has happened to her, so she begins to question different vampires around the city to see if any of them know her. Instead of giving her the answers she so desperately seeks, her questions eventually lead her into the middle of a centuries long war between the two kinds of vampires - the Spectavi, who only drink synthetic blood, and the Sanguans, who drink from humans. Just how far will Erin go to find out her past?Perlow did a great job with this book. While the characters were rather two-dimensional and the twists in the plot predictable, the story flowed well and was very easy to read and get into. The novel raises thought-provoking questions about morals and ethics and also questions the religious aspects of vampires and where they would fit into God's plan. The religious aspect and questioning really had me thinking at times, and it was a welcome diversion from most vampire stories that I have read before. Some avenues of the story were left unexplored, but hopefully they will be followed through in some of the upcoming books in the series. All in all, this was a good vampire novel that has the reader eagerly turning pages.Disclosure: I received my copy of this book free from Library Thing. However, this had no effect on my opinion of the book or my review.",1
645,5,"Die Autoren dieses lesenswerten Fantasy-Romans werden mir hoffentlich den Titel ""Schreibprojekt"" verzeihen.

646,4,A great story. Kinda jumped around and took a long time to explain things. I was kinda irritated when I checked in the next book in the series and discovered they are not in chronological order. I hate reading events/stories out of order. This should be listed as the third book not the first!,1
647,5,"I am a fan of Tiffany L. Warren' s book. I enjoyed this book with mixed feelings because of the places in life for these women who feels that going after a minister gives them a special status in the eyes of God, church and society. Thinking that they could be a better wife than the woman that he is married to, will be accepted by the church as the first lady and live a fairy tale life of happiness. The minister thinks that he is in the will of God by comparing his wife to the single women in the church, flirting with them and having sex with them. Instead, of working on his marriage he seeks ways to destroy it and the silly women have their hopes dashed. Why not trust God to bless you with your own husband? Have a higher self-esteem of yourself!!!!",1
648,4,"With such a crazy title as, The Zillionaire Vampire Cowboy's Secret Werewolf Babies, I wasn't sure how I was supposed to take the book seriously. Well, you aren't supposed to! The authors actually have a warning in the book letting the reader know it's a parody and not to be taken too seriously. Once I read that, I decided to just sit back and enjoy. I'm glad I did. I was already laughing before I got through the first paragraph. With character names like Rock Fangsworthy, Buffi Van Pelt, Billy Bob Bobson, and Chastity Feelsgood you just know you're in for a wild story.Even with the hilarious names, and the fact each chapter was written by a different author, the story wasn't all fluff. The entire book flowed well from author to author and never went beyond a level of silliness that made it painful to read. Rock and Buffi's storyline had depth and even being presented in a comedic way kept me reading to make sure they got their HEA.If you're looking for a good story to lighten your mood and make you laugh out loud, then you need to pick up The Zillionaire Vampire Cowboy's Secret Werewolf Babies! You'll love the way these characters interact with each other. Who wouldn't want to be serenaded with KISS' ""I Wanna Rock N Roll All Night"" by a drunk, sexy vampire named Rock Fangsworthy?",1
649,5,"This is a nice short ghost story about a little girl. A young girl, a best friend, and a pleasant ghost who needs to be helped. It also has a sample of another story. I didn't read that one but I really enjoyed this ghost story. No terror or horrible gross stuff. It is a gentle story.",1

654,5,Didn't want this book to end!  Tim is a endearing character who wants to right all the wrongs done to and by people. Be sure to be prepared to read straight through.,1
655,5,"It simply amazes me that this kind of quality writing is available on a Kindle for less than a buck.  Ponzo far eclipses some of the current works of well known authors and could easily charge more for his product but chooses not to.  Good for his fans!This thriller could have only been made better by being longer as it is a book you wish would not end.  The suspense starts, literally, on page one and doesn't end until the epilogue and even that is designed to make us wait (not long I hope!) for the next installment.  I really enjoy the fact that our hero is human, gets hurt, makes mistakes and is humble about his successes.  The inclusion of his shady cousin Tommy is a huge plus to the series, hope they never kill him off.If you haven't discovered Ponzo yet, download both his books immediately and you can thank me later!",1
656,4,"I am getting ready to start book 11. What a great series! I have written a few books and it is unbelievable to me that Mr. George has been able to make this series go so far, AND in such an entertaining way.Mystery - intrigue - bad guys, good guys, action, romance and great characters.Don't hesitate - start this now and you won't be sorry.",1
657,5,"Barbara Elsborg has a most unusual way of bringing characters together that are haunted by their pasts, and then are dealing with the impact that it has on their lives. Ash and Noah meet at a wedding, he's the photographer and she is a waitress, and their first encounter is amusing and had me smiling. Noah who suffers from PTSD, has an unpleasant incident while he's working and Ash comforts him in her own unique way. You feel the instant attraction that these two have for each other. That is what this author is so good at, the connection between the characters, and the reader.Ash has had an awful childhood, manages to live somewhat of a normal life, but is trying to compensate for the sins committed by others. Noah barely exists after his life is tragically impacted while he is on assignment in Afghanistan. She starts to bring him back to life, and he has her believing that she can find love. As the relationship develops, the magic begins and this is where the author really shines. She has a profound way of healing her characters through the passion and desire they have for one another. You feel every kiss, every touch and it warms you to the core. Barbara Elsborg's characters experience some awesome sex too! Then just as things are moving along nicely, the story has an unexpected twist and the angst starts all over again.This is a beautifully written story about healing and acceptance, with some interesting secondary characters and lots of terrific dialogue. Ash and Noah stayed in my mind long after I finished the book.I highly recommend this book and everything that I have read from this author.",1
658,5,"This book is WELL worth the investment!  While this book is billed as a ""Linked List of Over 1,000 Free Fiction Classics,"" it is MUCH more than JUST a list of books with links to purchase the free public domain title in the Amazon store!  The author has written a  biographical sketch for each author he profiles in this book!  I purchased this book today and have already learned SO many interesting facts about different authors.  Mr. Rosenthal writes in a very friendly, personal manner. You almost feel as though you are having a conversation with a close friend as you read his reviews.  His critiques of several of the featured authors have piqued my interest.  I am looking forward to reading some new ""old"" authors.  This is a valuable resource whether you are well-versed in classic literature or whether you are newbie looking to find more in-depth reading or just need to feed a voracious reading habit!The Linked List is also very helpful.

659,4,I found this story to be very intriguing in that the main character is in an occupation that most of us don&#8217;t think about it on a regular basis.  Evidently the character is very good at his job and the suspense keeps you turning pages from beginning to end.  I thought the plot was well thought out and I truly enjoyed reading it.  I&#8217;ll look for more of the authors work for sure.G,1

They find Kat sexy in her curvy appeal. She thinks they are crazy and have no idea what they see in her.When things take a turn for the worst, Liv must make a decision between love and sacrifice.

Hier wurde nicht auf die Schnelle was zusammengeschrieben, was am n&auml;chsten Tag schon wieder vergessen ist. Die Natur zu achten und zu sch&uuml;tzen - eine wesentliche Intension der Autorin - ist deutlich sp&uuml;rbar und die Geschichten bieten sich nat&uuml;rlich an, dar&uuml;ber mal ganz ungezwungen mit den Kindern zu reden. Die Weihnachtsgeschichte f&auml;llt in dieser Sammlung ein wenig aus dem Rahmen, weil sie doch eher etwas f&uuml;r die Gro&szlig;en ist - das kann man aber ja auch als nette Beigabe der Autorin f&uuml;r den Vorleser nehmen, der daran sicher seine Freude haben wird.",1

667,4,"This kindle short is a really good laugh. I loved Bob. I think we all know a character like this:  a person so set in his ways, resistant to new things, and cheap; a man whose best friend is duct tape because, afterall, they just don't make 'em like they used to! Why bother with the new stuff when the old is still working and still useable? Poor Bob, he ends up with some new-fangled gadget that changes his whole outlook. I was laughing out loud several times. The writing was that good. From the droll characterization of Bob to the deadpan delivery of Carol Ann, each word was effortless and natural and clever.",1
668,5,"If you judged this book by its cut-and-paste-clipart cover (like I almost did), you'd be seriously missing out. As a self-published author, Richard Goodship may not have an eye for designing a cover, but he sure as hell knows what to put on the pages behind it.The Camera Guy was remarkably brilliant on so many levels. It had the bones of an excellent detective novel, but it mixed in unexpected elements of the paranormal and theological. Think of this as a film noir-style detective story meets Angels and Demons and The Exorcist.It's hard to describe the plot and what's good about this book to a person not reading it. Trust me, I've tried. From the moment I told my husband, ""Well, the detective sees dead people - not like The Sixth Sense dead people but the victims at his crime scenes. And that family of ghosts that follows him around his apartment. But that's it."" I knew this was one of those books where you have to be reading it to really understand.Sixteen years after a tragic accident during a robbery set him on a downward spiral, Bill is a forensic detective and photographer who has lost his family, his faith and the respect of some on his police force. The accident that turned his life upside down also left him with the ability to see the spirits of the deceased at his crime scenes until they move on to... wherever they move on to.Bill seems to be resigned to living with his own personal demons, but when something truly demonic awakens to feed on the souls of the dead, he must face his past and his faith to stop it before it causes more carnage.And carnage, well, there's plenty of that in this book. Although I'm not into gory books, I'd say I have an above-average tolerance for those types of situations. This book even had my stomach turning at parts (and I didn't even think about reading right before dinner). As gross as it was, it all made sense. From a CSI perspective, the gruesome bodies gave clues to find the killer. From a theological perspective, it was so awful and unimaginable that you could not help but call upon faith to understand it.This isn't a neat-and-tidy story. There isn't an obvious hero or even cut-and-dry antagonist. I think that's what made it so interesting, though. You never really knew what was going to happen because the characters didn't abide by stereotypes.Anyway, great read. I hope Goodship gets on with his follow up soon!",1

670,5,"What?  A book with no f-words, no steamy move-by-move sex scenes?  For this alone the author deserves five stars.  Add to this a protagonist, who, in spite of her Olde Southerne upbringing, tries to help a person of another race?  Here you have a woman entirely believable with all her faults, prejudices, fears, respect for family, and too-too-precious upbringing who is still openminded.  What more could you ask for?So much for the character.  The plot is interesting, possible if not probable, and the writing style is light, humorous, and fresh.  The characters are treated fairly, with no obvious villains, only people less likable for reasons that are given.  Having worked in situations where the entire office seemed to be against me, I can relate to the way Savannah is treated by her co-workers.  Yeah, it happens.Altogether an interesting book, humorous, fast reading, and an author who shows real possibilities.",1
671,5,"This book will forever haunt my memory as the book the made me cry. I loved the beautiful flow and bend of the phrases in this book, and I'm still trying to convince myself that I'll ever find an explanation for some of the questions this book poses. Why do we love people? Not the kind of on and off crush, but the deep, compassionate love that drives us to sacrifice everything for someone. The kind that causes us to give and give until we're broken and ruined just so that the person we love will have a moment's happiness. Why do we allow ourselves to love? We know we're going to be hurt, even if it's not intentional. If anything happens to them, we're crushed, smothered beyond hope of experiencing any peace ever again, and even a frown on their face throws a devastating blow at our heart. Why do we constantly do things we're ashamed of? I believe everyone wants to be good, but even the right reasons lead us in the wrong directions. What makes something beautiful, it's correctness, or it's imperfections? I personally think it's neither, when someone's singing, and they hit the wrong note, it sounds terrible, but if you see a lovely woman with a scar marking her face, somehow her tragic happenings allow us to feel more connected to her. I think what makes things beautiful isn't flaws or lawlessness, it's feelings. Why are evil people disgusting? They don't feel remorse. Why are kind people amazing? They feel empathy, and act on it. It's our ability to feel and act on our feelings, or not, that makes us beautiful. Finally, and most enigmatic, why do we almost always trust our feelings over our deductions?",1
672,4,"This was quite the entertaining read! The cover immediately caught my eye, and after reading a few positive reviews, I finally bought this one yesterday. (really, though, isn't the cover amazing?)The Japanese setting seems as if the author did her homework (I'm no expert and have never been myself), nicely detailed and informative without overwhelming. I wasn't sure what to expect from the yokai, but 'Fingers' definately stole every scene he was in! Hands down, my favorite character. The karoake scene alone was worth the price of the book! (well, that and how poor Hank kept overhearing people wondering if his curtains matched his carpet! *snerks*)",1

When he picks her up, he realizes she is not the defenseless female that he had thought.This short story is not for the squeamish, but is a twisted story of a serial killer.

678,4,"I decided to give this book a chance since it was offered for free. I am glad I did. It's not the best vampire story I have ever read, but certainly is far from the worst. The character, Ava, has a lot of potential to grow and become capable of handling the lead in a series. The author does a decent job of picking through the pitfalls of writing, and generating a story that is unique, and simple in a very good way.It's a fairly quick read, and worth the download.I hope the author continues with the series, as I am very excited to read what comes next.Thanks to the author for writing a very good book!ps: hate the cover, sorry! :)",1
679,4,"The prologue and first chapter hooked me, I wanted to know what happened, but the half-book flashback covering the events of the prior week in the story, threw me.  By the time I reached the point where the flashback caught up with reality, I had forgotten I was in a flashback and a part of the story definitely felt disjointed. The smaller flashbacks (a page or less at a time) did not have that problem. I think the story might have been a bit easier to follow if those 2 chapters had been moved to just before the end of the first ""act"".The continuing battle of minds, bodies, and wills between Count & Meredith kept the story fast paced and engaging.I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and how the author kept things from being too easy for Count by making half of his support-base of friendships inaccessible right when he would need them the most.There are some problems that need to be addressed as far as editing goes, but the story as a whole more than makes up for that fact. I like the way the ""magic"" of the world is patently ""there"" but still un-believed in by most ""normal"" people. I really enjoyed the story and I sympathized with Count having to deal with major situations and not being at 100% capacity himself after getting out of the hospital.",1

681,4,"Mankind's Worst Fear by David L. EricksonThe story captured my attention and kept me up, reading late into the night. I find explaining where you are should be easy unless, it involves sending someone into the future, into the past and then back again. If not handled correctly it can become a real headache for both writer and reader. I feel that Mr. Erickson handle that tricky task with aplomb. A good read. It's also a look into a future we must avoid at all cost, no matter the cause, whether by human wars or, in this case, contact with aliens bent on the annihilation of the human race. Let's hope our exploration of Mars, sometime in the near future, doesn't result in the problems encountered here.",1
682,5,"Lalla Bains is an ex-model who has moved back home to Modesto, California to run her father's crop dusting business and trouble seems to follow her every move. She is a very strong willed, self-sufficient, head strong and curious woman. It is her curiosity and sense of justice that ultimately involve her in a murder investigation where she is a suspect.A Dead Red Heart is written from the point of view of the main character Lalla. R.P. Dahlke takes us on a roller-coaster ride of emotions, action and suspense as the mystery plays out. The drama and suspense are intense, action packed and even humorous. The writing style will keep you totally involved and on the edge of your seat until the final page is read.Each supporting character in this story I found to be extremely well defined, memorable and held a specific importance to the story. As each character is introduced the plot thickens and becomes more substantial. Even the victim Billy Wayne plays a large role in the story as we come to learn more about him and his struggles. You will find yourself developing a fondness for some of the characters in this book and be disgusted with others. All the characters are an integral part of the story and have very distinct characteristics.I thoroughly enjoyed this book and would recommend it to all readers who like a book that is entertaining, suspenseful, totally unexpected and has a love story mingled in with it.Marilou George - The Kindle Book Review",1
683,4,I read born at midnight a while ago and fell in love with the story. Della is one of my favorite characters and reading how she was created was awesome. I'm glad I finally read this and did so in anticipation of the last novel in the Shadow Falls series.,1
684,5,"This is a heartfelt story of loss, grief, and healing.  It tells of a beloved pet who died a year previously.  Jake is not only missed by his owner, but by his long-time friend and companion, the wolf-dog Annie.  When they finally visit Zellwood, the pet cemetery where Jake was buried, they both attain a measure of peace and closure.Ms Stroud has written a beautiful, finely-crafted novella.  She does an amazing job of conveying deep emotions and vivid imagery in such a short piece.  As an added bonus, the editing is superb.  Simply lovely - a must read for anyone who has ever owned a pet.",1

686,5,"Blaze Austin is hiding a secret.  It's been years since she rode as an outlaw with her father, but no matter where she hides, it's only a matter of time before he finds her.  When she's left for dead in San Antonio, James Ryder, owner of the Broken Circle ranch, nurses her back to health.  Feeling in his debt, she returns with him to his ranch to work as a ranch hand.Gade Ryder, away from home for twelve years, returns at a summons from his father, James.  Someone is rustling his cattle, and he wants Gade to find out who.  As a bounty hunter, Gade tracks down outlaws all the time.  The only problem is Gade's been estranged from his father for the twelve years he's been gone, and still can't figure out why he's returned.Gade knows Blaze is hiding something, and most likely she's involved with the rustlers, as well as having an affair with his father.  But that doesn't stop him from wanting her, even though he doesn't trust her.The Devil's Daughter is a well written, fast paced story.  The characters are fully developed and the story intriguing.  Although Blaze has an outlaw past, the reader quickly gains sympathy for her.  Gade is strong, and his compelling attraction to a woman he can't trust drives the story.  An excellent read.  This is the first book in the Devil Ryder series, sure to be a hit.Reviewed by Callie Hutton,Author of A Run For Love",1

This is a modern social history novel, with deep secrets, personal trauma and the difficulties.

691,5,"Lise Kimball has faced some daunting obstacles, and flat tire be damned, she's through with feeling helpless. Being married to a verbally abusive husband has served to make her stronger and more determined than ever to live life for herself. A chance meeting with the irresistible Donovan True while on her way to New Orleans brings to surface wants and desires that Lise had extinguished long ago. Nevertheless, she's unsure about trusting another man who is unbelievably capable of taking charge.Donovan True is a successful, confidently strong man and when he meets Lise and discovers he feels more than a simple physical attraction despite having just met her, he's helpless against that instant attraction.It's no secret that I have adored Alison Kent and her work for many years and I have to admit that I thought this book, given its length, might be a little rushed and perhaps even limited in believability. I was so very wrong with that line of thinking. The story is fast-paced but not to the detriment of character strength and realism. Alison Kent is an artist when it comes to putting words on paper and she never fails to engage her readers. I give AT HIS MERCY my highest recommendation. The book may not take hours to finish, but successfully tells a beautiful love story.",1

694,4,"Thin Air is so good. It is very interesting and fun to read.Alice was once a sylphid, a winged air spirit. She lived in the elemental realm making clouds. One day she ventured to the mountains where she spotted the guy of her dreams, Daniel. She instantly falls in love with him. She has heard that she can go to Gob, a king of another realm and be made human. Once she does this there is no turning back. She knows nothing of Daniel except she thinks he might live in New York City. Alice decides to leave everything she has ever known to become human and search for Daniel.The first few chapters or so focus on Aeris aka Alice when she is living as a sylphid. I didn't really enjoy this part of the book but it was short so it didn't really matter to me. The story gets really interesting and fun when Alice becomes human and lands in NYC. Her she meets a couple of elementals that have been human for many years. They get her started and one even helps her find Daniel in the first day or so. The only problem is that Daniel has a girlfriend named Delilah, and she is crazy jealous. Alice meets Daniel's roommates to begin with and they invite her to live with them. They think she is from upstate New York and has just moved to the city with nothing. Things end up not working out very quickly for Daniel and Delilah, which I was glad cause I didn't like her at all. Daniel and Alice begin dating and things are going really good. Then she learns that she is in danger. I am not going to give anything else away about the plot. Dont' want to spoil it for anyone.I will say that I really enjoyed all the characters, except for Delilah. I loved Dante and would love to be friends with him. He is so funny, loves to shop and is a great singer. I also really enjoyed seeing or reading through Alice's eyes what it is like to not know anything about being human. The simple things that we take for granted everyday she had to learn very quickly and without anyone noticing. I would highly recommend reading this. It is really good, there is romance, action and suspense. It is very well written. I am looking forward to reading the sequel. This e-book was provided to me by the author for review. This did not affect my review in any way.",1
695,4,"Innocenent Until Proven GuiltyBy Duane GundrumInnocent Until Proven Guilty is a murder mystery saturated with high level corporate leaders and those who will kill anyone who gets in their way. We soon begin to wonder if these may be one in the same as the murder of a corporate president is being investigated. The president's seat is filled with the expected person; however, it is soon evident he will not be there but a few hours. He has an vicious enemy, the man who is directly beneath him in chain of command. This enemy knows no limit in what he will do to purge the company and himself of the president so he points to him as the murderer. Corruption at almost every venue keeps us in suspense. Is anyone above reproach? How many will be killed before this murder is solved.Gundrum gives us a fast pace suspence thriller. His writing style is sharp and as long as you stay with him you follow. He seems to have a knack for describing suspenseful situations putting reader on edge of their chair wishing it would be over soon,all the while loving it. His character development is decent for a book in this genre. Because we do not know who the murderer is he likely holds back some on that character. Perhaps a peek a his psyche would have been nice. There is very little relational depth written into the story. No build up of a husband/wife relationship and no window to their inner sanctum. What you get in this regard is surface. The writing focus singles out suspense and he does a brilliant work in delivery.For those who enjoy a mystery without a lot of gore or a deep plot this is an excelllent choice. Get comfortable. Once you start you will not want to stop until the end.",1

His Mom is battling a bad divorce, when she's forced to put him in a special education class.  From there, you can hardly put this book down.  There's romance, a loveable child, nastiness in abundance and the milk of human kindness, enough to keep you turning pages to the end.",1
697,5,"I haven't read a thriller with a paranormal twist in a while and wasn't sure what to expect when I picked up The Camera Guy.  I wondered whether I might think it was so so.  In fact, I loved it.  It did bring to mind The Exorcist, The Omen, etc (which have all been done and done). Richard Goodship's book, though, brings a fresh slant to the genre that had me immediately wanting to read more.  The Forensic Investigation side (beautifully done, supplying just enough information to convince you that the author knows his stuff) added an extra dimension and an intelligent twist that had me quietly congratulating the author.  I have to admit to be being a bit of a Dexter fan, and I could (really) visualise this ranking alongside it.  Bill Walters is a fascinating character - flawed and believable - as is his reluctant psychologist/partner Tom.  The touches of humour between the two men is spot on. I can see this partnership running.  I liked that the religious undertones flowed through the book in such a way as not to weigh it down or detract from the story.  I also liked how Bill's daughter was introduced and subtly woven in throughout, eventually becoming a key element.Overall, an excellent read.  Highly recommended.",1

700,5,"I normally avoid war books and I don't really know why I read this one.  Once I started I was caught up in this very readable account of a young sailor.  What made it special for me is that the author (writing in his old age) manages to make you feel the emotions of the teenager he was at the time.  I was amused at his astonishment at the huge pile of clothing he was issued at basic training.  Growing up one of ten children in a poor family he had never owned more than a change of clothing.  Now he had five uniforms, three pairs of boots, three hats, and  underwear for a week. He wondered how he was going to help the navy win the war while looking after all those clothes!  This is not a lighthearted look at war. The things that this kid saw were gut-wrenching and remind us that all wars, no matter how unavoidable, exact a terrible price.",1
701,4,"ReviewI found a good mix of well-imagined science fiction stories in this collection. The strength of the author's imagination overcame a few minor storytelling deficiencies and left me with an overall positive impression. All of the stories were original, yet they often referred to well-known science fiction classics, and a handful of them delivered a powerful punch I will not soon forget.Story QualityMs. Fulda has a bare-bones style well suited to the expression of her imaginative and quite original ideas in flash fiction or very short stories. Her shorter stories, in which the thesis carries the thought, capture the reader's attention more completely than the longer works, which I found to suffer thin plots and lack of character development. ""Let There Be Write"" is a playful retelling of the Hebrew story of creation, with the accoutrements of the writing craft replacing the well-known elements of the six days of creation. This is such a charming and delightful bit of flash fiction I believe just about any reader would enjoy the story. ""Pastry Run"" was long enough that I found my mind wandering to the implausibilities of the scenario; if the story had been rendered as flash fiction humour I believe it might have been more effective. ""Dead Men Don't Cry"", the title story, I found possibly the weakest of the entries. This full-fledged murder mystery didn't seem to conform well to the rubrics of whodunits, with critical characters and facts revealed piecemeal throughout the story.I consider ""Blue Ink"" and ""The Man Who Murdered Himself"" the highlights of the collection. Both are imaginative stories regarding cloning, but a special type of cloning called ""molecular replication"", which allows the replicated individual to come face to face with the original from which she was created, with some quite profound consequences. However, ""The Breath of Heaven""--essentially a retelling of the HAL 9000 story, but with a very different outcome--with its intricate examination of directives was a quite plausible updating of the classic three laws of robotics, and in some ways outshone both Asimov and Clarke in the way the story unfolded. Finally, though perhaps not as strong as the cloning stories, I found ""A New Kind of Sunrise"", in which an artificially implanted group of humans faces the challenges of living on a world with physical constraints--and especially seasons and climates--very different from our own, to convey a powerful message about the value of individual thought and action in the context of stifling tradition.Writing QualityThis is the first book I have reviewed for SIFT that did not disappoint me due to deficiencies in basic writing ability. I decline to review most submissions, almost always due to elementary errors in grammar, spelling, syntax, or basic composition. Ms. Fulda is one of the few indie authors I have read who has demonstrated full command of the basic rules of the English language. In that regard, I found this short collection a real breath of fresh air.OverallIf I rated this collection strictly on the basis of the cloning stories and ""The Breath of Heaven"" alone, I probably would have awarded four and a half or five stars. However, I am obliged to rate the work as a whole, and for this reason I award three and a half stars. I feel just about anyone could enjoy at least a few stories in the collection, and some may rate a few of the stories, such as ""The Breath of Heaven"", as classics in their own right. Overall, I found reading this collection more delight than chore, and I hope Ms. Fulda will continue to challenge us with entertaining, engrossing, and thought-provoking tales.Three and a half starsReview by: Pearson of Sift Book ReviewsSift Book Reviews received a free copy for review from the author.

705,4,"Faced with a choice of becoming a vampire, going with the Army of Light, or death, Broderick MacDougal chooses to become a vampire.  Hiding his vampiric identity by travelling as a gypsy, Broderick travels the countryside seeking the man that slaughtered his entire family.As a young child, Davina Stewart visits a gypsy camp and has her fortune told by a larger than life gypsy who she immediately decides she will one day marry.  Davina carries the image of her Gypsy in her mind as she endures untold brutality by her abusive husband.Nine years after their fateful encounter, Davina and Broderick once again meet, this time there is no denying the attraction between them. As Broderick pursues Davina, she questions her beliefs and both must find a way to fight the dark forces which pursue them and possibly find a way to be with each other.Set in 1500's Scotland, Ms. Burnz gives us a slightly different twist on the lore of the vampire in Midnight Conquest, not called vampires they are vamsyrian, ruled by a council, subject to strict laws, they kill to survive and have no humanity. At least, that is what they are lead to believe when they are turned, we learn that even vamsyrians aren't given all the facts.Broderick is a very large, imposing Scotsman but even as a vampire (which I will call him instead of vamsyrian) he is a gentle giant. He is a warrior, was a nobleman in life, loves to laugh and not bad on the eyes.  He has an obsessive need to find the man that slaughtered his family, Angus Campbell, and is a bit short sighted about anything else. Oh, by the way, Angus Campbell is a vampire as well, and is the one who made Broderick into a vampire; he also has an agenda of his own.I have to admit, there were times I didn't like Broderick very much. He is a man of his times and can be overbearing and a bit of a cad.  In the end, while I may not have always liked him, I did fall in lust with him a little.Davina is your typical Scotswoman of the time, she marries who she is told, silently endures her husband's abuse and hopes for something better. She was slightly too malleable for my taste, I understand that the options available to women today were not available at that time but she tended to trust men more than she should have.  She did occasionally show some spunk and was a loyal, loving person to those in her care.  It's hard to say much about her without giving away spoilers, she was difficult for me to identify with but I was cheering for her by the time the book was over.There are some interesting characters in the gypsy camp that play important parts in the book and I actually enjoyed getting to know them.  Davina's maid and best friend, Rosselyn, has an important role throughout the book as well, again there is more that meets the eye with her.I did enjoy this book, I felt there was something missing that I just couldn't put my finger on and at times I felt the story jumped around too much, but despite that I did become engrossed in Broderick and Davina's lives. There are some intense moments of blood and gore, some not so nice scenes between Davina and her husband (whose name I refuse to even mention) and some steamy love scenes, none of which were out of context or even too offensive, but this is definitely a book for the adults.I would recommend this book to readers who are tired of the same old vampire books and would like a slightly different, darker take on the genre.  Anyone who enjoys the historical Scots highland genre will enjoy this; you can never go wrong with men in kilts.Reviewed as a Member Paranormal Romance guild Review Team",1

The storyline was engaging and involved enough to make a series out of, also ultimately quite romantic.I would place this on a par with Jenna Black or others of that ilk.

But, it is a touching, edgy and powerful story of a brave, damaged and worthy woman who finds the Man of Her Needs (as opposed to the Man of Her Dreams)The heroine is a survivor of a bleak and abusive childhood. She has used her pain and rage to transform herself into a brave and powerful vigilante. She is tall, sturdy and physically strong and capable of defending herself against danger.  She roams the night, looking for lost or injured animals to rescue and giving free Attitude Adjustments to any potential muggers, murderers and rapists who are foolish enough to accost her. She has changed her name from ""Julianna"" to ""Jo"", cut off her beautiful golden brown hair and dyed it black. She wears only denim overalls, flannel shirts and heavy boots.  Yet, even though Jo has tried to stamp out any part of her that soft or vulnerable and cultivate all that is tough and menacing, she is a gifted artist and she protects others from the evil activities of pimps, muggers and rapists and she rescues and rehabilitates injured and abandoned animals.One day, she meets Francis, a mysterious man, on a subway train.  He is not big and buff, he is not drop dead gorgeous, he is not sexy, he is not all raging testosterone, alpha male. He seems to be just an unemployed man who still lives with the two aunts who raised him. But he is gentle, likeable, friendly, intelligent, sensitive, respectful, generous, patient and understanding. Just what a brave, but damaged soul like Jo needs.The writing is excellent, there were only a few typos and I totally enjoyed the characters. Sometimes, a happy ending is more than just a gorgeous couple, happily ever after.I really liked that Francis, the hero, was completely uncaring that the heroine, Jo, was taller, heavier and far more physically powerful than he was. He was truly attracted to her spirit, not bowled over by unusual physical beauty, which is the common theme in typical romance stories.In this story, the average-guy hero was able to win the battered heart of the wary, edgy, less-than-perfect heroine. Beautiful and moving.",1

He's actually very intelligent and well versed in many different things. I really liked that about his character. I constantly waited for the other shoe to drop, like he's too good to be true. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that Megan had never heard of his music before or knew exactly who he was.

732,5,I have completed the Atnz trilogy and am awaiting the continuation.  I thought the book was very creative and detailed.  Its good to get a new twist on SciFi now and again.  My only complaint would be how short the books are.  These could have easily been combined into one book.,1
733,5,"I loved this book! It had all the appeal of a novel of historical fiction, but a bit of fantasy is also thrown into the mix. It's the first in a series of three I do believe. I will most definitely be getting the next two novels to read and review. I loved the characters and their stories. The evil Copeland is a great antagonist, and the grip he has on the fictional town of Scarlock is intense. His ""muscle man"" Blakey grows as a character in the novel, and at the end it's hinted that there is much more to his story than meets the eye.I adored the main character Nereia. She is a woman who is full of strength and determination, and I cannot wait to find out more of her story. Her fight to protect her sister is admirable, and it's obvious that their story is going to be a mainstay throughout the series. Vansel is another great character that the reader is able to learn more about as the first book goes on. He comes across as a roguish character with a good heart. However, he does seek vengeance for the murder of his father.I believe this is going to be a great series of books, and I am definitely looking forward to the other books. I am looking forward to see where the story line with ""The Mother"" of the Shantari people, the book begins with her going on a dangerous journey, but then she is rarely mentioned again throughout the book.I honestly wish the book had been a lot longer! It was a pretty quick read, and I would have loved to keep reading and learning about the characters and the different cities and lands that the story takes place in. Obviously I would recommend this book to anyone.I definitely give this book 5 out of 5 stars!",1
734,4,Saying there are 30 chapters is misleading unless you know the author because each chapter is a page or 2.  It is definitely necessary to get the book and finish the read.,1
735,5,I really enjoyed this story and it gives the reader a good intro into the series following this novel. A nice short story that introduces many of the characters you'll be meeting in the following books.,1
736,5,"This book was hilarious!!  I laughed so many times while reading this! =)  This was also a super good book and you should read it if you haven't done so.I didn't see the ending coming, although I was VERY pleased with it!  I like the cover of the girl taking a picture of the football player, but I personally think that the title could be a little different.  But I found this book to be very enjoyable and I would definitely read it again and reccomend it to other people too! =)",1
737,4,"Hot Commodity, by Linda Kage, is one sexy, thoroughly grown-up fairy tale with modern-day equivalents of princes, princesses, wicked witches, poisoned apples, the lot. The ""royals"" trade in commodities and make fortunes. The ""wicked witch"" is a scheming mother, and the poisoned apple's depression or alcohol. Fate plays the part of fairy godmother, bringing true lovers together. But now it's up to the young couple's hearts to determine if that's where they want to stay. If the bedroom scenes, played out with delightful imagination and abandon in various parts of hotel, house and street-corner are anything to go by, those hearts and bodies know far more than their still-confused heads. But then, these people have wounds in their past just as deep as any rejected Cinderella's and far more real; everyone knows you have to heal your past before you move on.Linda Kage's characters are vivid and fun, with great dialog and amazing moves, just sufficiently grounded in the real world to be believable, just sufficiently far above us minor mortals to be delightfully fun to read about. From Pasadena, to Vegas, to Chicago and beyond, from abject submission to brave determination, from haunted past to present to promising future, Hot Commodity runs the gamut of US locations and emotions. Secret pains are revealed and secret joys made known. And the reader is left to delight in the happiest of happy everafters. I'd love to see the movie.Disclosure: I won an ecopy of this book and volunteered to write an honest review.",1
738,5,"Laurel doesn't know what to expect when she asks out the big, muscle man she bumps into on the street one day. It's certainly not a warning that he's not her type of guy. Or an invitation to an underground event that's reminiscent of `Fight Club'. And Laurel certainly didn't expect the level of the big man's kink. Because Flynn likes to dominate - not just tie me up, tie me down either - Flynn likes to simulate rape and aggression on his willing bed mates.Laurel is at once horrified, intrigued and turned on. She's also got a burning desire to get to the heart of Flynn's kink, and maybe make the big man fall in love with her.I read `Willing Victim' because I adored Cara McKenn's stand-alone novel, `The Reluctant Nude' (written under her pseudonym, Meg Maguire).I went into `Willing Victim' a little hesitant. Because at the beginning of the novel there is a warning that had me a wee bit spooked; Reader Advisory: Although all sex acts are 100-percent consensual, Willing Victim contains role-playing scenarios that may upset some readers who are sensitive about rape, even in a simulated capacity.'I went into this novel suitably prepared to be disgusted and have my feminism insulted. But surprisingly (or not so surprisingly, since `The Reluctant Nude' was spectacular) this novel looks at extreme-BDSM and general fetish in a very earnest and revealing way, with utter sensitivity and intelligence.I will say that the simulated rape isn't as in-your-face as I expected. It's mostly to do with the fact that Flynn is aware of how strange (and potentially criminal) the whole situation could be. So he's very explicit and open with his lovers, about what's allowed and where to draw the line. He asks Laurel, repeatedly, to say she wants this and there is a safe-word involved. Having read EXTREME kink in the form of Kitty Thomas's `Comfort Food' - I have to say that `Willing Victim' is at the tamer end of the spectrum. That's not to say the sex scenes are boring or lacking in any way - they are incredibly sensual, and brutishly hot. I think it's more the fact that the book is about simulated rape and simulated violence, whereas `Comfort Food' was the real-deal and all the more disturbing for it (while still equally brilliant).I think the simulation was also somewhat less grotesque for Flynn and Laurel's genuine heat and connection. These two were great - I loved that outside of the bedroom they played with one another, laughed and joked and were quite at ease. But when the clothes came off, the heat turned up. These two genuinely clicked and that attraction came across and made the whole `fake-rape' thing just another aspect of their bedroom antics.McKenna also stayed true to her intelligent sensuality, which I encountered in `The Reluctant Nude'. McKenna (/Mguire) doesn't just write sex or kink for the sake of shock. There's actually back-story and explanation. It makes her erotica intelligent and all the more fulfilling. I was particularly impressed when Flynn accused Laurel of thinking him and his 'fetish' to be a disability, of sorts. Not dissimilar to a dialysis machine, something he has to drag around with him and be embarrassed by. Flynn articulated what Laurel (and I) was secretly thinking.Cara McKenna writes sensual and serious erotica for the thinking woman. Her characters are intelligent, complex and compelling. Her kinky situations never favour shock over story and it makes her erotica all the more fascinating and sexy.",1

741,4,"At his son's wedding, an older guy meets a younger guy (the bride's estranged brother) and they fall in love, declaring that weekend, ""you're the only one for me and I'm gonna love you forever.""  Hmmmm....we all know this DOES NOT happen, but that's why these books are ""fiction.""  It's cute & sappy; definitely not a story with depth or a riveting plot.  Two or three sex scenes (they're not HOT or SIZZLING - just ok).  Read this when you're at the doctor's office or at the airport.  Not for your ""must read"" list.",1
742,5,"Railroad Volume One: Rodger Dodger is one of my first forays into the world of steampunk and if this is what steampunk is all about I LOVE IT! The characters created by Tonia Brown are fantastical and vivid...highly entertaining. Rodger Dodger is exactly the type of person you think of when you read his name, but maybe with a slight more compassionate quality then his name might suggest.  Professor Hieronymus J. Dittmeyer, well, just his name is loveable, but he's that quirky professor you wish you had in college, but never was lucky enough to end up in his class. Highly intelligent, kind and considerate to a fault, but with that eccentric quality that makes him just plain likeable. Ched, the engineer is right up my alley, too for reasons that you will have to read to determine. Rodger, Dittmeyer and Ched are not the only characters in Railroad Volume One: Rodger Dodger, there are other lifeforms in this tale of the odd and amusing, but the Sleipnir could be viewed upon as a character. She is a magnificant wonder of the modern world and is able to run without tracks to wherever location the Professor deems worthy of an adventure.Set in the Old West, Railroad Volume One: Rodger Dodger has that feel of ever present danger of a gunfight just about to happen as a tumbling tumbleweed rolls past. The combination of the Old West with it's saloons, steam trains, Colt revolvers and the out of this world abilities of the Sleipnir and her crew make this a highly imaginative and entertaining read. Seriously, I could not put it down and I CANNOT WAIT for Volume Two...did you hear that, Mrs. Brown? ;)Obviously, I definitely recommend Railroad Volume One: Rodger Dodger to purchase and read multiple times.",1
743,5,"I LOVED this story!! I would give it more stars, if I could. It was so well-written, I re-read it immediately, lingering on the details. I loved the dark, edgy, REALLY bad boy anti-hero, who was definitely NOT perfect.  The heroine is beautiful, but that is not dwelled upon as much as her character: good, brave, valiant and proud, but stressed, lonely and tormented, too. The writing is extremely good, top notch. The characters are extremely well-defined and believeable, especially for such a short work.  The sex is steamy, sensual and actually necessary to the story.  The editing is extremely good; no typos, grammatical errors, misspellings, or missing/wrong words.The fans of perfect-hero-and-heroine-happily-ever-after-all-wrapped-up-in-a-neat-package may not ""get"" this story.  The hero, Dardanus, is an assassin and womanizer:  highly intelligent, devious, bitter, and full of anger at the lifetime of cruelty and disrespect he has received as a royal bastard. Although he is a trusted advisor to Nestra, the queen, he is killing and scheming his way to take the throne from her, because he deems her too weak to rule the country effectively. But for all that, he is a man of principle (his own code, not others'), a patriot who loves his country.  The magic amulet Nestra wears protects her from attempts on her life, so he schemes to seduce her into removing the amulet, so that he can kill her. What happens is a very touching story of love and redemption, with a great twist.*Spoiler Alert* Even though many reviewers did not understand the ending (and so assumed it was NOT happily ever after), it HAD to be a happy ending, for this reason:  The entire story was told in the first person, from Dardanus' point of view.  Therefore, even though it ends with his belief that he will die in the morning (as a result of his actions), he is alive and telling the story, so the queen MUST have forgiven him.I got this as a free download, but this author's work is so awesome, I am definitely going to spend actual money to buy more of her work, ASAP.",1
744,4,"I really enjoyed this book.  So much so that I've read it twice.  It's very well written, with an interesting plot, and well drawn characters.  Furthermore, Ms. Richardson has her characters behave in a manner that is fairly true to form for the Regency period.  Caroline is a heroine among heroines.  She's super-smart, and very serious minded.  Caroline eschews frivolity of any kind, and has absolutely no interest in going to London, having a season, or getting married.  Nicholas is a wonderful mate for Caroline, as he shares her interests in intellectual pursuits, and social issues, but provides a balance as he can appreciate some of life's more frivolous pursuits.  It doesn't hurt that he's handsome, sexy, titled and rich.  LOLWhen Caroline and Nicholas first meet, she's only a child of some eleven year.  Nicholas is a guest at a party being given by Caroline's aunt.  Caro overhears her selfish, vain, mean-spirited cousin Lavinia, carelessly laughing off Nicholas' proposal.  When Nicholas discovers Caro eavesdropping, she pretty much tells him he got off lucky.  LOLYears go by, during which time, Caro's father (who is brother to Lavvy's mother) dies, leaving Caro an orphan.  She spends the years of her childhood between school and her aunt's home.  As soon as she is old enough, the independent Caro takes up residence on her estate--inherited from her father--and assumes its management.In the meantime, Lavvy married her Earl, who five years after their marriage dies, leaving Lavvy a young, wealthy widow.  As soon as her enforced mourning period is over, Lavvy is eager to get back to her social pursuits.  She invites Caro to London to lend her a respectable countenance--it would not be the thing for her to be living alone.  Caro very reluctantly agrees, and begins to make arrangements for a removal to London.Before she can begin her journey, she and Nicholas have their first encounter in six years.  Nicholas is now a Marquess, after the untimely death of his elder brother.  This is the first of many more encounters.Once Caroline arrives in London she and Nicholas are constantly thrown together, as now that he's a Marquess, Lavvy is determined to have him.  When Nicholas seems to be falling back under Lavvy's spell, he finds himself a target for Caro's scorn.  LOL  I have to admit that I was completely irritated with him myself.  But, on some level his feelings rang true, as I'm sure it's hard to get over your first love.  Yet still, I called him an idiot more than once.  LOLThe story that unfolds is thoroughly engaging; the romance very sweet.  The romance between Caro and Nicholas develops at a slow, natural pace--first a friendship based on their mutual interests develops which slowly grows into love.  To add a bit of fun to the plot are Lavvy's two darling boys, who are sadly neglected by their self-centered mother, but who form a close-knit relationship with Caro.You should know that there is a lot of introspective by the various characters throughout the book.  I actually liked it, as it gave me insight of the various characters at varying points in the story.  However, I know that there are some readers who don't like it when an author spends so much time in the minds of the characters.  It doesn't usually bother me, unless it's overused, and IMO it worked for this story...I just wanted to put it out there to make prospective readers aware.I did have a few minor issues with the story.  The biggest being with Caro's age.  She seemed too accomplished for one so young--at one point in the book, we learn that Caro was 11 years old when she and Nicholas first meet.  If that is indeed true then that would make Caro only 17 or 18 years now.  Assuming her to be that young, it's not very realistic that she would be allowed her own residence, even with a companion--she would have to have a guardian, which presumably is her aunt's husband, Lord Mandeville.Another, although minor--issue, is that it's been six years since Lavvy's marriage, how is it that she has a 6 year old son...what happened to the  40 week pregnancy period? (So many authors discount the gestation period.  LOL)Lastly, after bringing up the issue of how Lavvy was sure to react when she finally realized that Nicholas and Caro had developed feelings for one another, the author fails to provide the reader the satisfaction of witnessing that event.  More than once--three times to be exact--throughout the story, it was noted by one character or another, that Lavvy's reaction to the budding relationship between Nicholas and Caro would be something to see, that ""she's not one to give up such a catch without a fuss"" and that there would be ""...a rare to-do...""  I was really looking forward seeing that.  Consequently, when the story ended before Lavvy is informed that Nicholas and Caro are engaged, I felt cheated.I also did wonder what was going to happen to those darling boys now that Caro would no longer be living with them, and they would be once again relegated to the care of an indifferent parent.  That issue gave me a moment (I definitely over-think the books I read.)Those issues aside--and granted they are pretty minor--I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it as a very engaging read.  FYI, it is a clean romance.  Happy reading!",1

747,4,"Faith and love can get you through anything. That is the message that is woven throughout Mended Heart. An engaging couple and vibrant supporting cast are the star players in this tale of two people finding peace... and each other.Jade McAllister grew up on ""the wrong side of town"". Childhood tragedy shaped her early life and her mother turned to alcohol and a parade of men. Shane Calkin was her opposite. He had the proverbial silver spoon in his mouth. His parents had money - lots of it - and to say he was privileged would be an understatement. He also had the stereotypical attitude of a young boy from a ""good"" family and popularity.In high school, Jade and Shane danced around their attraction for each other, but it was never meant to be. Jade was too self-conscious, and Shane was too aware of his peers and what they would say if they were to date. Instead, he teased her and was a self-centered jerk. After graduation Jade was finally able to leave on her own. She did - and she didn't look back.Ten years later, Jade has returned to the small town in Tennessee that she grew up in. Over the years, she's been repairing her relationship with her estranged mother. When her mom has a heart attack, that's all the reason she needs to pack up and come home. With a new job as an administrative assistant, she plans to take care of her mother and try to find her own faith. Much to her surprise, Shane is the youth director for the church, and the two of them are just as attracted to one another as they were in high school.Shane and Jade are lovely - kind and generous, they get through problems with grace and dignity. Shane has a deep and abiding faith and while Jade is struggling with her belief, she also puts herself in God's hands. Their interactions with friends and family illustrate how good their hearts are, and their care of the kids in the youth program at the church is touching.Throughout the story there are themes of tragedy and loss, all underlined by the conviction that faith can see you through to the other side. Watching Shane and Jade find their love for each other is very organic and natural feeling - the two seem meant for each other. Though secrets and fear work to keep them apart, their deep feelings for each other bring them together.Mended Heart is a sweet story of hope, love and forgiveness. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who is looking for an inspirational tale with Christian themes.Reviewed for TheRomanceReviews.com",1

750,4,I really enjoyed this book and have read all the Knossos snake series. It's an interesting shapeshifter world that Stella and Audra Price have created. This is the first book in the series and the price is an outstanding value.,1
751,5,I have read everything by this author except this series.  This was an oversight as I had purchased but not realised I had not yet read the book but had neatly filed it away.  I loved it.  There is something in the mood created by Heather's writing that makes you uncomfortable.  You can't help being a little scared for Logan who despite her crush on Dominic is helpless in the face of Sam's power to get underneath her skin. This is on display for us to see without forgetting the YA audience.  It is tasteful but still exciting.As always it is the way we can connect to the characters that makes a difference to our reactions.  Some of the plot is predictable but who cares because the story is already one that you need to continue reading.  I can't wait to read the next instalment and definitely look forward to the final book in this trilogy.  This is excellent reading for young adults but just as good for the rest of us.  It's all about style and I can't resist this author's style.,1
752,4,"Awww, this was such a sweet read!Quinn won my heart from the start - so shy and reserved it reminded me of myself. Cassandra Gold really put Quinn's emotions out there on the page for me to relate to him easily and become really involved in the story.The concept of a singles' trip was very interesting to me and developed very well. The setting was very detailed but not obnoxiously descriptive, which can sometimes throw me off a story. I really felt I was there hanging with them at the parks.Josh was the perfect match for Quinn. He understood him very early on and really tried to make him comfortable on their outings. Through his efforts I got to see a different side of Quinn - funny and sarcastic, with a very tender heart and sexy as all get out. The first time they got together I was grinning from ear to ear. It was explosive, but as sweet as I expected it to be.I would have loved to keep on reading. I'm sure it would have been even better to see them in their day-to-day life.",1

758,4,"Three Days of Dominance is a story full of heat, passion, and intrigue. Author Cari Silverwood has managed to create something unique in the paranormal genre, combining elements of BDSM with fantasy. The result is something that is refreshing, although certain elements fail to reach their full potential.The heroine, Danii, is a police officer who has no problem standing on her own. Her job isn't easy, so she turns to alcohol to dull the pain she experiences. Fortunately, happiness exists in her life in the form of her companion and dog, Killer. One day while walking Killer she finds herself in a spot of trouble. To her shock, a man offers to help her in exchange for three days of obedience. Thinking he's a bit confused and out of sorts, Danii agrees, although she has no idea what exactly it is she's signed on for.Several elements of Three Days of Dominance ensure a reader will keep turning the pages; namely the hero, Heketoro. He seems to exist at the lake where Danii encounters him, but ultimately he is a mystery. Ashis story unfolds and you learn of his history the book takes on a paranormal/fantasy edge. At this point Danii has to reconcile her feelings for the strange man she can't stop thinking about, decide if she believes he is what he says he is, and choose whether or not she wants to help him. These portions of the story are heightened by sizzling sex scenes that erotic romance fans are sure to enjoy. Although it should be stated that the scenes, while containing dominant and submissive undertones, do not delve too deeply into BDSM play.Never fear, however, as the chemistry between Danii and Heketoro is explosive.While there are many positive things to state about Three Days of Dominance, there are negatives as well. First and foremost, there are scenes within the book that, at first glance, appear to serve a purpose. However, they are never fully explored or utilized to the fullest extent. For example: the reader is told on numerous occasions that the ceremony that must take place to return Heketoro to his realm is very dangerous and could put Danii's life in danger. There is a lot of build up to the actual scene, in which the reader is informed Danii will have to show absolute obedience. Yet when the scene arrives, it's extremely hot but disappointing. Likewise the ending leaves much to be desired. While the Danii and Heketoro have their happily for now, their journey begins anew. Perhaps Three Days of Dominance is part of a series, which means readers will discover what occurs at a later time. Considering the genre and source material it is worth noting that, while the book does resolve the primary conflict in Three Days of Dominance, the ending appears to be the beginning of a new story.The technical aspects, such as writing, pace, and style is solid. Ms. Silverwood has a lovely voice and an ear for dialogue. The interaction between her characters feels very organic and her sex scenes sizzle. As an added bonus her world build is fascinating and she's laid the foundation for a very compelling series if she decides to take Three Days of Dominance beyond one book.I would recommend this novel to fans of erotic fantasy with BDSM elements, particularly those who enjoy stories involving magic and mystical creatures. If you've not read Three Days of Dominance this just might be the story you're searching for.Originally posted at Whipped Cream Reviews",1

763,4,"Danika makes it a point to know how to do things herself. Anything a man would normally do like home repair, Danika would prefer to do it herself. Just as well she is used to dating ""safe guys"". Safe guys won't take her off course with her goals and plans, but the lack of heat and chemistry in the few relationships she's had might leave her in control, but very sexually frustrated. What she really wants she knows she shouldn't have, but a couple of meddling sisters have decided she needs help whether she wants it or not. However, there is a method to Danika's dating madness. Heat and chemistry come with complications and Danika would like to avoid them as much as possible, so she avoids dating the men she really wants in favor of those who are expendable. It's a safer decision and less of a distraction until she meets her match in carefree, uncomplicated Sam Bradford. When he makes her an offer she can't refuse, Danika soon finds the first flaw in her dating logic and finds the heat she hadn't realized she was missing.No romance. Just sex. Sam is more than up to the task of having a one-night stand, but he's excited about the challenge that Danika presents. Orgasms are his specialty and if there is one to be found with Danika then he is determined to find it using any method necessary. First things first, time to find out what makes Danika tick sexually and then give her the confidence to ask for it. His cockiness in this particular area serves him and Danika well until mentoring her in the art of orgasm turns into something completely unexpected and completely not what Danika's sisters wanted from him either. Sam doesn't want to be needed by anyone and his reputation as a love `em and leave `em type is proof that when you get involved with Sam expect nothing. He's enjoyed his bachelorhood thus far, but something about Danika makes him want to be a better man and that includes being wanted and needed. However, Sam's own personal demons hold him back from truly accepting everything Danika has to offer, so he does the one thing he's always been good at - put emotions aside and withdraw from the situation. But not wanting to be needed has a few drawbacks and Danika is prepared to push Sam to his limit.Of course I should have known after reading the first story that not even a good `ole fashion seduction can go according to plan when a Bradford is involved. After a series of unfortunate and hilarious events, what starts out as a trip to the lingerie store ends unexpectedly in a trip to the ER. Sam and Danika don't want to become familiar with each other and let it get more complicated than it needs to be and yet they don't even realize that they are doing exactly that within minutes of agreeing to their mentor/student arrangement. Their verbal sparring was great to read and timed well. Both characters are witty and undeniably compatible even though their dating history and personalities suggest otherwise.While this is the second story in The Bradfords series, it is not necessary to read the first in order to appreciate the second. However if you have read the first you can expect more of the same in this story: plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, sexy fun times, unexpected character depth, and a storyline that feels like somewhere in Small-town, USA this could really be happening. So if this sound like something you'd enjoy, be sure to check out this series.Originally posted at Long and Short Reviews",1

The author hints at some really interesting and complex characters, we just don't have enough time to really get them. You could feel the connection between Riley and Maggie right away and I was excited to watch their relationship grow. The storyline had me hooked right away. I thought it was a cool concept and I wanted to see how it would play out. It fell a little flat because it was so rushed and we didn't really get all the answers we should have. I really wished I had time to learn more about Maggie and her background.

766,5,"This is wonderful to have.  It works perfectly.  I had no problem when in Europe.  I was able always to charge my Kindle, without a problem.",1
767,4,!!!really excellent quickie. Love these short erotic stories and the best part was that it was free!!  Recommend to anyone!,1
768,5,I hope Kristi Burchfiel will publish more devotionals as she is just terrific.  I would certainly purchase from her again.,1
769,4,"True there are a few steamy reads in Celestial Seductions but also multiple missed opprotunities to develop the story line into a real novel.  Wish there had been more details regarding Mateo, the menege, sub and dom etc, the characters careers etc....Ms Bradley completely skimmed over the majority of the juicy bits.  I would say 3.5 stars, I feel cheated.  The story is well written and worded so this would be a good starter menege but I feel like the author just pumped out a short story for $$ and I'm upset because she is obviously capable of much more!!  Will probably follow this author to see if her work developes into something more evolved.",1
770,4,"that I didn't notice that this was a children's book before I downloaded it.  I don't mind reading YA' s, but as an adult I don't have an interest in young literature.  I also am embarrassed to admit that I actually enjoyed this collection.Yes, it was juvenile--but it's meant for a younger audience, so it's supposed to be.  I found the plots to be reasonably interesting, the stories not too scary, and the character development to be quite good.  I especially liked the grumpy Grandfather and the bratty toddler sister.For its target audience, I give it a solid 4-Star rating.  Even this adult found it entertaining enough to bring a grin to my day.",1

772,5,"If you've tired of vampire romance novels and think they're all the same, THE MERZETTI EFFECT may make you change your mind. Norah Wilson creates a vampire mythology that is a bit different. Yes, it's based on the vampire as virus theory, but there are some twists and turns along the way that keep you glued to the story and turning those pages. Good characterization--especially the spunky heroine--gives the reader someone to root for, and the solid grounding in medical technology and practice gives the book an authority that helps one suspend disbelief. Then there's that out-of-left-field twist that the reader should see coming--but doesn't.Well done, Ms. Wilson. You hooked me into your vampire mythology and made me immediately click to buy Aiden's story in NIGHTFALL, the next book in the series.",1
773,5,"REALLY enjoyed this book! Others will delve into the characters and plot(s) of this triolgy so I'll pass on that. I found it to be well written, held my interest and was a fun read. The ONLY drawback (which really doesn't bother me too much) is the quantity of editorial errors throughout the book. Wrong words, words omitted etc but not enough so one can't keep on going.Will read more from him!One thing I really, really liked in this was the story of the origins of so many phrases we say, how they got their start, what they mean.....very interesting.",1
774,4,"HOLY EVIL INFANTS BATMAN!!!That baby Natasha is one creepy kid...I love babies, but I think I would run from this one...I kind slightly understand the bad feelings she has towards her father Neal, because he wanted her mother Annie to have an abortion, but I think this crazy kid wants everyone dead...She is only 5 months old but has already tried to kill both of her parents...I was thinking at first that all of this might just be from the father kind loosing his mind but after the incident with her mom, nope that baby is pure evil! This is a very good read I was pleasantly surprised and I will have to read book two for sure!",1

776,4,"I don't usually read secular books but somehow I picked this book up in my Kindle. For my followers this is not a Christian Fiction Book, There is some foul language, adult situations, and some sexual encounters, although there is not much of any of these things. I did like the book. There was a  very good story line and I found the whole concept intriguing. The characters are awesome. You find yourself rooting for a man that is just a vegetable. How cool is that?Rosa Solorio is an aide at Riverwood Care Center. She notices that one of the patients, Chad Lett, is able to follow her even though the man was diagnosed brain dead. She is able to communicate with him and get a response. She tells the doctor but he doesn't seem to believe it. She decides to run off with the patient but disappears after the attempt.Westley Pilson takes a job at Riverwood. His twin brother is a patient there and he believes Eric is being abused. Wes is a law student studying to be a medical advocate, so he takes some time off of school to make sure his brother safe. He replaces a woman, Rosa, from Costa Rica. She just walked off in the middle of her shift. A couple of her friends hear him speaking Spanish and try to find out if he knows what happened to Rosa.The rest of the book is a journey to find out what happened to Chad and how the cover up changes the whole world for Wes and his family. A story of greed, manipulation, murder, and vengeance. I am very thankful that I don't have a family like these people. Maybe it is a good thing not to have a fortune because it causes men to do horrendous acts of violence. I love the way the book ended. I will have to read the next book, The Devil's Peak. You can find out more about Michael's  books at m.wallace23@yahoo.com or get it from Amazon.  God bless you for reading my blog today.The Devil's Deep",1
777,4,"Liked this book,it was fun to read and hi'ms character was different then most men on these love stories Have read-only of her books this one is up there with one of her best.",1
778,4,"If you love historical romance with plenty of steamy scenes, read this book. I liked the main couple, who went through a lot to be together. There were times when the words seemed too modern but it wasn't distracting. I look forward to reading more of this series.",1
779,5,"I love the Playhouse series, and Flaunt It is the perfect introduction! In addition to being completely hot for each other, Ben and Piper care about each other. Anybody who has ever wanted to take the next step in a relationship but feared the consequences will identify with their situation. I also love the interplay between Ben's reluctant voyeurism and Piper's exhibitionism. The next book in the series, Risk It, continues the theme, and I just love the way the two stories work together. While Moore dishes up some seriously sexy sex, she doesn't skimp on the emotion in this very satisfying story! A great bedtime read!",1
780,5,"love it that it zips to protect my Kindle Fire from dust & crumbs from my purse.  This is my second one, I wore out the zipper on the first one after a year.  I would recommend this",1
781,4,"4.5 starsFrom the first few pages I was unsure where this book was going as it seemed more chick flick than about to go into urban fantasy. Sure enough it did build around Nicole and soon enough we know that the dreams that she has been having are warning her. So much so that she saves a life!This is just a small introduction into I'm sure a very much larger story in the rest of the series. Chick flick in the opening stages but builds into intrigue and there is a bit of romance mixed in too.Definitely intrigued to see where the author is headed with these. On my must read list!Speaking of which, what are YOU reading? Let me know in the comments :-)",1
782,5,"I love historical fiction, so I couldn't resist giving this one a go. What I love is that this novel manages to balance the historical facts of the recency era with the satisfaction of a romance that doesn't turn sour. That can be very hard to do when writing about love between two men in a time period where it was so taboo that the consequences were severe. Yet despite the difficulty of this task, Fessenden manages it rather well. I will definitely be reading this one again!",1
783,5,"This may clock in as a quick read but you get a lot of story and rich well created characters. This short little book does it right, introduces you to the characters and painting a perfect picture in your mind without a lot of wasted words. I really liked how she gives you a few comical rules to live by at the beginning of each chapter that gives you a hint of what is to come.Growing up in a house where my mother is a  Shitzu breeder I was able to really relate to the quest of Candice to get her dog to the prized stud. I really liked how you really fell into the story of how nothing at all went right but maybe that is the best things that happen to us. I have to admit I might of been a little choked up at the end.This is a book i would recommend and look forward to more from Jenna Anderson.",1
784,4,A selection of stories that make you think or space operas that can send you into tomorrow adventures or interdimensional travels.,1
785,4,"I was given this book for review and found that although it was short it has a powerful message.  I liked the 'dark, dark' and understand the reasons behind it.  It also enjoyed the writing style which flowed and unfolded the idea well - the ending jolted the senses - like any good story.I don't give spoilers but will say that this is a thoughtful and thought provoking tale.",1

788,4,"The Moshi Moonrock is an affordable earbud-style headset with soft warm sound, though not as tough as the unfortunately cold sounding Philips Tread.  It is not resistant to sweat and water nor good for sport or fitness activities.  Fortunately, it sound great, the bass is strong up to too much (good for rock music), even though slightly boom-sounding & muddy. The mids sound clean, clear, & detailed, but a bit back in the mix. The light & crispy treble sometimes disappear.  The audible noise lessens when it is worn over-the-ear.It comes with a solid plug unfortunately not L-shaped, a not indestructible Y-split, 2 thin soft cables above the split that may tangle, an average not reinforced cable, in-line microphone & controls, 3 sets of differently sized (S, M, & L) stiff silicon ear sleeves/tips, and stylish case. Each plastic earpiece extends into the plastic cylinder originating the thin soft cable allowing also the over-the-ear wear. The sound releasing nozzle is protected with metal mesh. The right size silicon sleeves fit well and provide good sound isolation.",1
789,5,"Very well written, strong characters, and storyline great. Really hard to put this book down. Highly recommend to those, who enjoy the WWII genre.",1
790,4,"""First Bite: The Wicked Queen's Tale"" is a bit like ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead"", making minor character major and major characters minor.  There's an interesting take on the origin of the wicked queen, bringing an ancient story into the mix.  Some familiar characters are here, such as the Huntsman, and there are new characters, too, such as the witch's assistant Fortulla.This tale was nicely done--in fact, this is too good a story to suffer from mistakes like: ""Swiftly, silently, for their was no time to lose.""  Arrrrrgh!  Ok, ok, I'm a grammar/spelling Nazi and the misuse of their-there-they're makes me crazy.  As does excessive use. Of incomplete sentences.  For emphasis.  Clean this stuff up and this story would be 5 stars.",1
791,5,"It's not easy finding post apocalyptic or post global disaster books that aren't either over the top in one way or another and it's been many years since I've had the chance to read one that didn't seem too outlandish or just wasn't set right.Mr. Sides first book in his Peacekeepers series accomplished that. I read the sample and immediately one-clicked the rest. I found his story setting, details, characters to all be well-written, highly detailed in the places where details counted and easily understood. Each character, from Jim, Patricia and down to little Evan were all real to me and that is a vital element for me as a reader.The action was well-founded, not cliched as some of these style books can be and never boring. I enjoyed his dialogue between the characters. Now as for some of the complaints listed in other reviews, I didn't see it. I didn't see Mr. Sides treating his female characters in anyway that degraded them or made them lesser characters and certainly while there was violence in this type of book I honestly would have wondered about it if there hadn't been. I certainly can say as a female reader that I wasn't offended and thought he handled Patricia very well.I don't normally give or say if you like a certain author then you will like so and so but in this case and for readers of the old Guardian series by Richard Austin then give this series a try.",1
792,4,"not your typical world war ii French resistance  story, but some of the same characters are there:  the evil gestapo colonel who cruelly tortures people, the corrupt and incompetent german major who, as the procurement officer tajes what he wants to lead the good life, the rich german industrialist who is making a fortune from the war and plowing it back into destroying the reich; and two young and beautiful girls who have no qualms about sleeping with anyone who will get them what they want.  one is a flat out collaborator and the other is trying to rescue her father who is held in a Nazi insane asylum. fast paced and exciting with a bitter sweet ending.",1
793,5,This was a very enjoyable book. I liked the willingness of the main characters to do what was right to care for their child. I was impressed with the strong willed women in this story who let nothing stand in the way of getting what they wanted.,1
794,5,"When I hit the click to get this book, I did it because it was on a free day for the book. I admit it. I'm in a different sort of reading groove right now and this genre wasn't what I was looking for. I'm so very glad I clicked.I read this in two marathon sessions and did almost nothing else so I could keep reading. It was that good.Imhotep is a figure of mystery in history. His tomb has never been found and he excelled at some many different fields he is almost bigger than life. He also made huge leaps in knowledge, at least based on his work that appears to be true, and so the mystery around him is even deeper. This novel gives us a wonderfully imaginative romp through time to find him.Tim, our main protagonist, is a man at the nadir of his life. He has suffered a senseless and devastating loss and is now alone in Egypt carrying out the trip he was supposed to take with his beloved. He sees something odd while visiting a tomb and finds himself in the distant past along with two other modern age people. The adventure that ensues forms the basis for our time and secures the rise of the great civilization of Ancient Egypt.The amount of research the author must have done for this book is staggering. Every single aspect, from the food to the climate to the way in which the people are portrayed is incredibly detailed and, I believe, astonishing in accuracy. Based on all that one can read or discern from historians and anthropologists and archaeologists has been wonderfully distilled into a fast moving and intelligent story.The cast of characters is large but each is very unique and easy to tell apart. Despite Tim being our central character, it is another character...let's call him Apy...who really steals the heart.Super enjoyable and recommended for those who like a mix of alternate history type science fiction, historical novels, smart fiction and even mysteries.",1
795,5,love this book...now i own all five books of this author on my ebook. I wish she would publish more books now...i am waiting and really excited about all the other books that will be coming out with the series.,1
796,5,"Seriously, the first line goes like this ...  ""Not bothering to shave, Nick McGraw pulled on shorts and yanked on a tee shirt."" If there ever were a first sentence to grab my attention, that was it.  Nick's character was oh so yummy and I just couldn't get enough of him.  Cassi is a fiercely independent woman with an inner strength which are must have qualities to me in a leading lady.  There are several examples I could give but all would give away a part of the book.  I can say, however, the sensual tension between Nick and Cassi is electric.  Sparks fly off one another when they are in close proximity.  I held my breath during each encounter they had with each other and continued to want more throughout the book.There was a remarkable plot twist in the story that was very unexpected.  I found this twist to be fantastically planned out.  The villain was dark, twisted, demented and a character I loved to hate.  The stalker's voice throughout the scenes was very prominent and dark.  A vast difference from Cassi's, which made all of the scenes with the stalker so believable and edgy.Deadly Reflection is the type of book I couldn't put down.  My favorite elements of this book were the progression of drama and the increasing suspense.  Nancy Kay set the perfect pace, included characters that I became personally invested in and blew my mind with the ending.  What more could a girl ask for?  This particular author has a fantastic ability to weave a story in such a way that I hated to see it end.  Which is why I was pleasantly surprised that Deadly Reflection is book one in the Deadly Triad series.  Yessssss!  Look for book two:  Deadly Revenge to hit shelves on February 1, 2012.  Highly recommended seems like such a cliche' label when giving my opinion of this book.  My opinion is so much higher.  Deadly Reflection is a book that you just can't miss.  I absolutely loved this multi-faceted story.  Anything Nancy Kay writes from now on will be an automatic add to my ""have to have"" books.",1

799,4,"We all fantasize about being swept away by a prince. Christine Merrill paints a fun picture of that fantasy complete with a small foreign country, a royal wedding, and a dashing, sexy prince. Loved it!This novella mentions the movieThe Prisoner of Zendawhich is based on a classicbook. I haven't seen the movie or read the book, but I plan to. What a fun concept. A royal figure must choose between love and country.Merrill can write sexual tension. Yes she can. This story shows that. The sex scene was pretty darn hot too. I enjoyed the humor and sass of the main female character, Dana Miller. The Royal Prince of Seravano was a bit cold at times, but hey, he was under a lot of stress. I think his personality fit the story.This ebook contains more than a handful of typos. It got slightly irritating after a while, but not enough to make me dislike the story. A good editor will fix this. Also, I encourage the author to preview the ebook file on a Kindle or smart phone. The formatting is off in quite a few places.* Review Edit 4/13/12 - The author has uploaded a revised edition.Even with these issues, I still enjoyed the book very much. I'd love to see more titles like this from the author. Her success as a Harlequin author is obvious. Click on her author page to see all of those titles. I feel she would be a great writer for young adult humorous titles. Please give that a try. (We need more humor and fewer books focusing on girls who are angsty vampire bait.)The Tourist of Zenda is a fun, quick read. Pick it up.",1
800,5,Oh man my lust for Aleron has just sky rocketed!  He has so much depth to him that you can't help but fall in love with him.  Just hearing about the pain he has had to suffer for so long makes me want to wrap him up in my arms and wish all his pain away.  Often times an author will show torment in their characters but its hard to put yourself in their shoes.  This however was not the case in this book.I loved how Eden made the coming of these two people together through Hex and Nissa.  It's a perfect round robin to have them help Aleron find the love he so desperately needs.Oh and Ever is just wow.  I can not get enough of him.  Oh so very hot and he seems to deeply care about his friends.  I a secretly hoping that he gets his story.  Not only because I want to see more of this handsome man but because I seriously don't want to see the end of this series.This book is a must read. And well worth all five stars and then some.,1

Vivian Arend takes us on a roller coaster ride of emotions with this one. One minute your on a sexual high (be on the look out for ""the chair"", that's all I'm saying) and the next you're laughing at the cute banter between the three of them have with each other, to being so made at the characters for heartbreaking moments.This is a great addition to the series and we even get a sneak peek at the famous Nick Blackthorne... sigh...

The introduction of the Alpha and Lupina of the Wolf Breeds. The Feline's have Sanctuary and the Wolves are building Haven. The premise of the story line sets a new slant on shape shifters. If you enjoy the genre you will find this book a good start in the series. The author notes on her website that the series was published over a few publishing houses and the series sequencing is hard to catch because titles are not set in true order and the mix between the different breeds makes for confusion in reading the titles. The sequencing on her website and the book descriptions are sketchy or incorrect. However, if you want a summer series to read, this is a good light read.7 out of 10 Bookends",1

813,5,"I have to say Jessica Coulter Smith is doing something right when it comes to shifters and the like. If you have not already done so I suggest you read the prequel of the series called Whispering Lake. These first two books can be read as standalones though. I was hoping to see Cole's story, knowing that he kind of got left holding the bag in the prequel. So a quick recap, Cole is out and about in his wolf form when he stumbles upon Marin an injured battered woman. He calls for help from Cassie (Whispering Lake). Turns out Marin is a mate to one of the super hot brothers (in age order Gabriel, Cole, and Michael; the latter two are twins with different color eyes). Turns out Marin has been abused but is strangely comforted by Cole who adorably stays in wolf form to make her feel more comfortable.This book was given to me for an honest review.First, I want to say that I really appreciated the blending of the prequel with Moonlight Protector it was flawless. Second, the title is aptly named. Cole the lead male in this story is the protector in both human and wolf form. Cole purposely keeps to his wolf form for the comfort of the lead female character Marin who has been kidnapped and abused. Third, the humorous element to this story helps cut the serious nature of the topic. I really felt that the comic relief was pulled off nicely. My favorite scene is when the dirt bag who kidnapped her appears at the family's Victorian home asking for Marin; Cole and Marin come out of his room all over each other pretending that they have been up to no good, while Michael the constant jokester plays with the whole charade in order to protect Marin (the scene is a lot funnier than my lame attempt and summarization).I really enjoyed the twist that if you are a mate then your packs blood can heal you, I found this fascinating from an anthropology standpoint. I wondered if evolution specifically selected for something like that (just an errant thought). There was a great blend of drama, romance, paranormal, and mystery. Once again Mrs. Coulter Smith has transported me into Ashton Grove, Georgia and made me lose track of time. I was so absorbed in the story I missed Lunch! And I love lunch LOL.I recommend adding this book to your reading list and you will not be disappointed.Book Summary:Cole Andrews, biologist by trade and werewolf by blood, is tired of being alone. He and his two brothers live in the large Victorian home that had belonged to their parents. He's always wanted to find his mate and start a family. Now that he's in his thirties, he's starting to give up hope. He's already seen all of the women available in his small town of Ashton Grove and so far none of them are ""the one.""Marin Thomas is fleeing for her life. After being abducted and held hostage, she is determined to escape the maniac once and for all. Stealing his car, she travels as far and as fast as she can - until a car accident lands her in some woods near Ashton Grove, Georgia. Fighting for her very life, she finds herself begging a wolf for help.Is Marin the mate that Cole has been waiting for? Or will she end up with one of his brothers? One sniff tells him that she belongs to his pack. The only question that remains is who will win her heart?",1

Hannah or Kya (her birth name)is just the shifter to do.  She was a very likable strong heroine, with none of the wimpiness that sometimes can mar a story. I like strong female leads and arrogant men who aren't afraid to show their softer side.  I wasn't disappointed in either character even though Hannah has her hands full changing this stubborn panthers mind!  Ahh the challenges ahead for Hannah with him!  I'm a little envious!

We get to meet the true Kat when she spies the naive best man, and let me say 'whoo' she may be selfish but she always gets what she wants. Ultimately, this could lead to trouble. Trouble and unwanted attention, lustful needs and wants. A read packed full of naughty insatiable behaviour. Fabulous and filthy. First class erotica!",1
822,5,"Another fantastic book by this author!  It does not disappoint.  Not being a real history buff I wasn't sure if I would enjoy it as much as I did.  I highly recommend it!!  Keep them coming, M.H!!",1
823,4,This was a great summer read! If you enjoy contemporary romances than you should enjoy this book. The love scenes were a bit spicy but not over the top. The characters were believable and you really cared for this couple and the banter between them was fun to read. The story line was very well written and it moved at a nice pace. I know it is a great book when I want to know what happens to the characters after I have finished reading the book.,1
824,4,"Has a very unique plot that uses witches and magic! Is also erotically hot and descriptive! It should be an interesting series reading about each of the four brothers, I can't wait to read the next one! VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",1

826,4,"With a tale of Andrea and Raphael, we are drawn once more into the fascinating world of magic vs. tech. I really like the story as well as the story writing...it keeps you going right up to the end. A definite read for all who are immersed in this world as I am...",1
827,5,"I love all Tymber Dalton books apparently even when she write under another alias.  This is a great M/M/F book.  So if that is not the genre you are into you might want to hold off this book, because there a steamy scenes between both men and when Sarah becomes involved it just gets better.  I really liked this book for a couple reasons they is a great storyline you wonder who the killer is and the creepy messages he sends her just make it a great thriller that you don't want to read in the dark and the hot hot love scenes between the three characters is to die for...Read it you won't be disappointed.",1
828,5,"Excellent short glimpse into one of the fantasy worlds created by William King. A Guardian of Dawn is on the run and encounters a family, who ask for his protection from something that lurks in the nearby forest.Captivating enough to make me look into other books by this author.",1
829,4,"I found this under science fiction/fantasy listing. BUT  its a modern day setting, and a lot of musical descriptions. The young woman who is the ""hero"" is suicidal, and  in with a a musical group that calls up a 'whirlwind' or a devil, whatever you wish to call it.  so not what I expected. but its very well written, just needs some content cut (I just skimmed thought it, flipping pages till the background descriptions became interesting again)a bit on the spooky side, a small bit of romance, a lot of everyday  and modern day reality. don't know that I would read it twice, but a nice book.",1
830,5,This book is just as good as the first in the trilogy. Another one that I couldn't put down until it was done.,1

834,4,"I've been told a lot of books are 'like Twilight,' but this is the first time I've been reading a book and actually found it very similar to Twilight. Part of it was the author's style of writing, quickly shifting emotions and lots of internal female teenage drama. Part of it was the sheer strength of the connection felt by the two main characters for each other. And part of it was just something about the heroine reminding me of Bella. In any case, I would say similar things about this book that I would say about Twilight -- while I can see and understand the flaws, I found the book very compelling and had a hard time putting it down. I also would REALLY like a sequel. That said, even though there were many unanswered questions (or potential questions) at the end of the book, I was also perfectly satisfied with the ending.",1

She had to fight off Vampires and Werewolves by herself, but stumbled upon many unexpected things during her time aboveground, including her first love.Initiation combines dystopian, post-apocalyptic and paranormal elements in a well-written young adult novel. Rebecca Royce remains true to her character's voice throughout and the plot is far from predictable. The emotional depth (which is very important to me as a reader) of this novel made it easy to invest my time in the characters.I look forward to reading more from Rebecca Royce, especially the sequel to Initiation, Driven.",1
836,4,"Heather is an unofficial member of the Carrington family. Brenda has been her best friend for as long as she can remember. And Brad has been her secret crush for equally as long, but he treats her like a brother. As everyone is preparing for a friend's wedding, the girls decide that Heather needs to take control of her love life. But will Brad be included?This is a fun, light read. As usual, there are some grammar errors that take away from the story, as well as one glaring continuity error involving Dan/Bob. There is some sex, but it's not too graphic compared to most modern romances. Dialogue is also witty between the two girls in the opening chapter, giving you a feel for the characters right away. I do have a problem w/the idea that a successful business owner would forget to lock the door when closing, especially given the circumstances (can't say what they are without giving a spoiler). 3.5 stars.",1
837,5,First Bite was thoroughly captivating and with a story line that just draws the reader into the characters lives!! I highly recommend this book to read. You will not be able to put it down. Excellent research by author!,1
838,5,Wonderful series----I have enjoyed every book so far. Look forward to the rest of this series.  Recommend to everyone.  This author is a very good writer.,1
839,4,"Favorite quote: There were dozens of great lines but these are my favorites from BAD COMPANY:""This bulletin is brought to you from the Department of Duh.""""But after everything that had happened, Nate felt like he was tiptoeing on sleeping alligators.""Ms Mitchell is one of the best at character development, and that talent shines through in BAD COMPANY. I fell in love with Kellan, Eli, and even Nate, and wanted the HEA to happen for all of them. Eli's happy ending will have to wait for another book, but it does happen for Kellan and Nate.I loved this book and could hardly put it down. As soon as I finished I grabbed the next book in the series, BAD BOYFRIEND, and I'm sure it will be a winner, too. This is a great series about a group of gay men who find that for them family is defined by your friends and without your friends you don't have anything worthwhile.",1
840,5,This was a great book.  I loved the way the characters of Jason and Titus developed.Inspiring book for all readers.,1
841,4,Good book is just a little short.  Enjoyed this book is a good story if you like a secret affair.,1
842,5,"Not sure but I liked it a lot. This book is short but does not feel like anthing has been left out and best of all this is just the Book 1 in a series that could go on and on.At first, I did not want to read this book based on the description and I'm glad I finally just went on and read it. The story starts with Ariel a Human woman who has been kidnapped by horrible looking aliens that want to use her to breed. They discover that her sex organs don't match with theirs and she would surely die it they even attempt to mate with her. Instead, they decide to give her to the other race of people that they have enslaved.She is won by a warlord type alien that looks part alien, part human and barbarian.At first, I'm thinking that this will be a sad story of two people living and loving each other while they are enslaved. (If I tell you more then I'd be telling way too much of the story.) Lets just say do no assume that Ral's is a barbarian and nothing more.This book is a hot, fast paced, funny, and highly enjoyable.Happy Reading.",1
843,5,"Marsha Canham has been writing novels for a while now, yet until this year I failed to read any of them. It was such a pleasant surprise to discover her through a free read, which it is not available any longer, of `Swept Away' which I highly recommend as well.`China Rose' is a love story filled with sensuality, intrigue and action. I liked everything about it and recommend it to any of you that haven't tried this author.Book bought from AmazonMel for b2b",1
844,4,"I loved this book. Brutally honest and hilarious. It's a diatribe of a man against man-made conventions and morality. It was like having a conversation with a friend - one-way conversation, that is. It's written as the way normal people talk when they are amongst friends with plenty of booze and having a good ole philosophical discussion about relationships/lust/sex, etc. Yes, normal people, at least normal people around here use as much profanity as the author used in this book when they talk amongst friends. If you are not an uptight person, have an open mind, and read a great deal of books, you'll love this book for its honesty and humor and something to think about, occasionally, not too often. Hope he write a sequel in the near future.",1
845,5,"Okay, so I know this is never my genre. I love I/R romances but you know how sometimes you read a blurb for a random book and it stays with you? Well, that is the story of ""Claimed (Brides of the Kindred)"". Baird is an alien race of warriors called the Beast Kindred. After being tortured the only thing that keep him going is thoughts (dream sharing) of Olivia Waterhouse (Liv)on planet earth. Once he escapes he arrives to ""claim"" her, but Liv has jus graduated from nursing school and looking to start her life. Although the sexual attration is there, Liv doesn't want to leave her career, her twin sister(Sophia), or her life on Earth. Baird wants to start his life with her in every way. Now Baird has 4 weeks to prove to her that they belong together and each week they get a little bit closer to ""bonding."" Can Liv resist?Personally, as I said, I wasn't looking for this book but I am a stubborn women as Olivia and although I wanted her to be with Baird I realized all she would be losing. I saw both sides. I don't want to spoil the ending but I will say ....Love wins. The imagery was great! I invisioned everything from the ""bathmat"" to the ""teddy bear."" I wish all couples could have the four weeks of bonding because it might make for happier marriages.I look forward to reading this whole series when it comes out. I know there is a story for Sylvan and Sophia. Although this is not Interracial it is Intergalactic!",1
846,5,"No existential or teenage coming of age angst here! What we seem to have is a man who is going through a mid-life crisis of sorts. Donovan Grant is hiding - not really from himself or from his fears - more, it would seem, from his past or from events which during the length of this brief introductory excerpt, remain as yet undisclosed to the reader. He has a respectable, decent if poorly paid job as a pilot ferrying passengers from Fiji to a swank island hotel which seems to be well within his skills. But he's also abundantly aware of his shortcomings and he's wrestling with these demons - an overactive libido, a fondness for the demon alcohol, a sense of insecurity, the memories of a marriage that somehow rotted out from underneath him, and an almost incapacitating inability to make simple decisions.While the excerpt is purely a basis for building Donovan Grant's character and gives no indication of the Agatha Christie type mystery which is referred to in the synopsis, Doug Wicker's writing to this point is pure joy. His dialogue is so completely natural and witty. Even in this brief excerpt, the humour ranges from outrageous puns to wry groaners and hilarious belly laughs. In fact, it is so engaging that I groaned with dismay as I reached the end of the sample introductory chapters. I've got my fingers crossed hoping he finds a willing publisher who will let me get to the rest of the mystery.I only have one question. Is Old Abbey Brown Ale a real English beer? It sounds delicious. What a great name!Paul Weiss",1
847,5,"Just like the second one of the series, I laughed out loud at this book too. The humor is great and her writing is awesome. Keep up the good work. I will redo the third one of the series also.",1
848,5,"I was thrilled to see another Dark Elves story available!  If you want a story unlike any other them this is the one for you! The characters are unique, highly intellegent and gifted, as well as erotic. Jet has a way of making the story flow so that you become enveloped in the characters, their plights, loves and desires. Unlike a lot of erotica stories, I find the Dark Elves Series to be well-balanced with story development that is unique, characters that are amazing and erotic enough without being distasteful.  Another well written story! Please keep them coming!",1
849,5,"This story kept me hanging on, not being able to predict how it would unfold and end. I have a strong sense of justice and this book brings that justice out remarkably well. It's also a sad indictment on the fact that there are many in our world who do not support a fair, just, moral lifestyle. At least in this story, truth is the victor and those who are evil are called to account for their deeds. Rebecca writes beautifully and draws you into the story, the mark of a great storyteller!",1

But the beautiful female with the sad eyes pushes him to his limits, and when the evil scourge come after her his vows will be put to the test in order to protect her.Sophia has allot of fear in her at times it was almost too much, but watching her journey toward healing you see just how much she needed someone to take care of her.Sylvan is a big old teddy bear, although he looks like a grizzly most of the time. He has allot more feelings running through him than he wants to admit, but I loved seeing that side of him.They both have pain from their pasts, but you can tell right away that if they can both get past it you can see they'll both have they happiness they deserve.The story of Liv and Baird also continues as well as the the beginnings of Kat and her story. And the story of the Scourge and what they are after continues in this one as well. Old and new I loved seeing it all come together in the second book of this series.",1
851,5,"This has to be one of the best Naughty Nooners I have read. I think the main reason is, is that it was very believable. It was a simple modern erotic tale of an older woman, a retired model turned author that has a very young, Doctor boyfriend. She honestly believes that he is getting sick of her, bored, and ready to move on to greener (younger pastures). That part is not the part that I relate to. What said hot young Doctor boyfriend does to her in this wonderful story was not only drop dead sexy, but it was for me so very romantic.One thing that I am not shy about, it is my sexuality. I believe that if more women simply trusted in their own bodies and explored all their options they would so liberated and happy, to be blunt. I love women that explore this in erotica. I believe that erotica is a literary gateway for a lot of women. For me personally stories like this make me lift a brow and toss it at my better half and go read that and turn fiction into fact. I don't read and write erotica to be perverted or dirty. I write it for women, for myself, and because I'm totally comfortable with that style of writing.This story, the way it was written, and how totally fulfilled I was with a simple short story instilled in me that I was totally doing the right thing in exploring my options as an erotica author. It was written perfectly, to the point where I could void the characters out and put myself in that story. Books are so much better than porno movies. Because your mind tells the story, not some fake bimbo on a TV screen that just makes you feel like you need to lose twenty pounds before you get naked for your husband or boyfriend. This story gave me a real woman, with real insecurities. It turned into one of the sexiest shorts I have read to date. I will defiantly be looking up more of this authors work!",1
852,5,"J. C. Owens&#8217; books are on a short list of automatic-buys for me --I have loved almost everything I&#8217;ve read by her, but I probably enjoyed Draconian Measures the most. The juxtaposition of the two first-person perspectives is unusually clever and well done. On one page, poor Graitaan is fuming about the obnoxiousness of Finnarians in general and his commander in particular. On the next, we hear Sadan&#8217;s musings on how adorable his &#8220;little Draconian&#8217;s&#8221; temper is. The back and forth between them is bright and witty and full of energy--their sparks not surprisingly give way to scorching sexual heat. Unlike so many romances, the conflict between the couple does not feel at all contrived, but is an inevitable expression of their personalities. Though you never doubt the deep attraction there, you also know it cannot be easy for someone like Graitaan to give in to what he feels and submit to Sadan.All in all the chemistry and wit made for one of the most satisfying MM fantasies I&#8217;ve read.Note: this is technically the third of the Gaven books: I read it first not realizing it, which did not create any problems for me. I would highly recommend the other two, but this is my favorite.",1

854,4,This is a cute story about a raindrop that falls into a river. Along his journey to the sea he learns important lessons like how he should flow with the current but not get caught up in whirlpools where he goes nowhere. The story seems to have deeper meanings but is written for children. At the least it will teach a child about the water cycle.~The Rebecca Review,1
855,4,Simply outstanding.  Too bad every day can' be like this book's ending.  The main characters are very special.  Buy this book!,1
856,4,"You know it is one thing to know and not do, but a whole other thing to not know and can't do. This story is very profound. I first caught it a few months back, and with apologies to the writer, I thought it was a piece of fiction mainly because I just cannot fathom parents waking up a toddler out of their sleep to entertain to keep them going. But that was the middle of a depression and times were tough. I really thought it was fiction in spite of the picture and all. As I kept on reading it, I will say this now, I have absolutely positively NO LOVE for Hot Papa! NONE!! If I was the mother, once I got a few thousand and a bank account, he'd been serious history. This lady loved this man knowing full well he was a zilch on handling business for family. If anything, he was all about himself and himself ALONE...He left his family at times during the off season in abject poverty. A tent in the middle of the winter with little or nothing to eat, gambling off their trailer for a little money, taking the best watch or jewelry off your own wife and children's bodies because you just had to gamble, that is low down and funky. And when they got grown and the mother was past tired, he banished her from the stage and told her to go home. sadly, he died tragically himself but to me it's karma. then, the kids barely got an education, so in essence, they couldn't read, write or anything. That is some sad business. real sad, but Flossie overcame hers and eventually earned her high school diploma. great story.",1
857,5,"One you won't want to put down.  A good plot, with traditional loyalties,  scumbags, and good guys that keep you interested in what's next.",1
858,4,This was a different type of (Shifter) book and I liked it a lot. The danger and suspense kept me interested and the only thing which could have been better was the ending. It left too many questions unanswered and seemed rushed. (probably to get me to buy the next book! :) I would recommend it especially if there is a second book coming so I can find out what happened next.,1

861,4,"Good girl Emily thinks that taking a job as a 900 number operator is the most daring thing she's ever done.  Then one of her clients ends up dead, and she thinks its up to her to find the killer.I'd rather give this book 3 1/2 stars than four, but no way could I give it only three stars.  The book was fun, silly, and totally girly.  In fact, it reminded me of Caprice Crane and other of my favorite chick lit authors.  Emily, the main character, was immensely likeable and easy to relate to, and her friends were also well written.  The prose was smooth and the plot moved at just the right pace - not too slow, not too fast.  I also loved the Florida setting.  I know that a few FL natives mentioned some nits with the location, but for me (a native Michigander), it was very convincing.  And considering this is a story about a phone sex operator, the author managed to keep everything to a PG-13 rating.  All of these things made the book a cute, easy read.Unfortunately, there were some things that troubled me quite a bit.  The first was the romance.  The love interest was just too perfect.  Too cute, too understanding, and way too forgiving considering what Emily puts him through.  The leading man lacked depth and personality.  Another thing that bothered me was that there were too many coincidences, especially at the beginning and end of the story.  I found myself thinking, ""Really??"" when Emily just happened to be at the wrong place at the right time.  Finally, although I understand that these kinds of books need to be zany, a lot of Emily's antics were too outrageous to be believed.  She poses as a number of people in order to dig up information on the murder, yet no one ever questions her credentials, nor does she get into trouble for impeding an ongoing investigation.  This really bothered me.Phone Kitten did have its flaws, but it was enough of a good read for me to enjoy it from start to end.  I think this is the author's first novel.  If so, I hope she'll put out others.",1
862,5,"I enjoyed the book ""Nutter Nero"".  I will reread it many times in the future.  It was so brilliantly done, he was such an engaging character, and the way the action was broken up into a series of little sketches which kept the readers attention...  It was charming.  ;)  I liked the way Maverick was drawn to Nero's odd personality and looked after him.  I liked the way Nero spoke; taking one thought through a long train of logic in his mind, then just speaking out the results, leaving his listeners totally confused about how he had arrived at that point. Nero wasn't good at speaking to people and the author skillfully conveyed his troubled but hilarious attempts at it.Gunnar was really good too, in that he completely accepted Nero and didn't get annoyed with him.  The cosplay was out of left-field in a good, weird way.  It showed Gunnar was a deeper character than showed on the surface and actually a really funny, imaginative guy. He was really the right guy for Nero.  I wish the author would take those characters and make one more book about them.  Or a whole series.  Nero and Gunnar could make a great detective team.  I don't know how many crimes would be solved but it sure would be a fun ride. ;P",1
863,4,"Kafka's House was a good book, well-written and interesting.  While the subject matter is serious in tone, there are burst of humor throughout the book as well as sadness.  The author shows us what life was like in Romania in the mid-60s, both before and after Russia invades and communism takes over.  The protagonist in this book is Silvia, a bright 10-year old who shares her life and house with her mother, father, and 3-year old sister.  We see how they live in a tiny house where the children's beds are in the kitchen.  We learn about Silvia's hopes and dreams, her friends and school.  Her family is poor but there is love in their household.  There's even a bully that Silvia has to deal with.  Almost every day, Silvia has to go to a neighbor's house to purchase something her mother uses for cooking, and she learns a lot from the neighbor's sister, Ana, who longs to go to Prague.  I thought the book read more like a slice of someone's biography than fiction, which made it more compelling.",1
864,4,"Just loved the storyline and it was done very, very well.  I look forward to more books by Johnny Fowler.",1

With her three latest books Julia Barrett  has become much more than just another romance writer. This is a very original story where the hero is, well, the hero is dead. sort of.  Parts of his body are very much alive. Sara and Nathan are great together. I would like to see a little more sexual variety, but sex is not the main focus of the story--just a great side benefit. The dialogue is very sincere and true. The story is about love bearing all, and winning it all.The story has some edge of your seat thrills and some tissues-at-hand sad. When Julia originally pitched this story she was told you couldn't kill of the main love interest. As feisty as her heroines, this spurred Julia on to the task!To understand this story. You have to accept that the hero is dead but not dead. You also need to set aside your disbelief for Julia's world building. I would like to see both a little more character development and a little more emotional range and demonstration. I didn't feel the chills that Sara felt in the action scene. And a few questions continue, unanswered. I can't say which because of spoilers. Not  all the mysteries need to be solved, the world building is an example. But there are a couple of ""Wait, what about...""I recommend this book; because it is very original, interesting and intense,",1

870,5,"I loved Shadowman, so of course I had to read this novella by Kellison. Though some of the characters make an appearance, Ellie and Cam have their own story. I love the separation of self between Ellie and her shadow, and how her story ended. The romance was a little fast for my tastes, but Cam's protective instincts are understandable. I hope to see more of Ellie, and her shadow, later in the series.",1
871,5,"Have you ever read a book and without realizing it started playing the soundtrack to the story in your mind? Well, let me tell you, one of the songs that would have to be included on the soundtrack for Second Chances would be Theory of A Deadman's Not Meant To Be. The last lines of the song are a poignant picture of Rori and Jude's story.""It's like one step forward and two steps back no matter what I do you're always mad.And I, baby I'm sorry to see maybe we're not meant to be"".I've been a fan of Lauren Dane's writing since reading the Arcadia Wolves series and as such I fully expected to enjoy Second Chances. I was NOT disappointed and actually became so invested in the story I had to finish it the same day I started it. I'm pretty sure I lost sleep reading it but it was well worth it!The storyline is incredible. I thought I knew the direction it would lead when I began but every time I thought Ms. Dane was going to zig she zagged. She hit me with some powerful and emotional story arcs that left me breathless and close to tears at times. The initial story of ""ugly duckling returns to small town home as a swan and hooks up with high school bad boy crush"" isn't so much a new story but what happens next was totally unexpected and kept me glued to my e-reader for several hours.The character development is strong and defined. You know who these people are and actually want to know more about the family and friends that surround them. If I haven't made my point clear enough...you won't want to put this book down! I only award Best Book status to books that truly touch me and keep me thinking about the stories and characters long after I've read the last pages and for me Second Chances was that type of book. Bravo Ms. Dane and I honestly can't wait to see what you give to us next!Originally posted at Whipped Cream Reviews",1

873,5,"""Dragons from the Sea"" is the second installment of the ""Strongbow Saga"" which is the story of a young Viking warrior participating in the Viking invasion of what is now France.  This is a story of warfare, friendship, and feuding, betrayal, and hatred besides.  Every bit of it has a gritty air of authenticity, which is a distinguishing feature of this novel and series.  In no way does this novel seek to whitewash the grim fact that the Vikings waged war for plunder and glory, and wreaked real havoc on the Christian world and beyond.  But for all that, Vikings were people who lived real lives and were not all one-dimensional bloodthirsty murderers either.  The author does a splendid job presenting a balanced and I think realistic portrayal of Danish Vikings.The characterizations in this novel are as good as the storyline is engrossing.  Highly recommended.  RJB.",1

875,5,"I Love how this author gives us (her readers) the dialog that we so much crave. There are so many authors that go pages and pages giving you snapshots of a character's mind, but very little dialog. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy picking inside the character's head, but there is no better way to learn about a person that by talking to them and Kelly's characters can talk!Loved all the references to Autism and even the time she spent giving her reader facts and statistics. Usually, these types of things are touchy and somewhat boring when put in a romance story, but here, it just blended perfectly fine with the scene. The topics of their radio show were great and the answers even better! The infertility effect on men and how Bastian dealt with it was interesting.I loved the banter between Charlie and Bastian, I loved the side story of Cas (Boo). It was so moving and felt so real that I could almost hear him playing the saxophone in my head. I would love to see a short story on Casper and Maggie with updates on Charlie and Bastian.Although I read a few reviews of people that ""hated"" Charlie, I somewhat understood her fears. Children of single or divorced (uninvolved parents) do grown up with fear of never finding their forever, of not having anyone to trust enough to give your heart to them. Charlie fit the bill perfectly. I loved her personality just as much as I loved Bastian's.One of the things I enjoyed the most was the fact that Kelly took her time to give the reader closure at the end. To let us live through the wedding and first night rather than summarizing it in the epilogue.I give this book 5 stars.",1
876,5,Great opening scene.  I have traveled the waters where this crash took place.  Mr. Shubaly's description is spot on.  A good read.  Thank you.,1
877,5,I live in a town adjacent a 'medium' sized city in Massachusetts.  The local newspapers leave a lot to be desired.When I REALLY want to know what is going on... I read &#34;The Globe&#34; ... It gives me what I want to know in a timelymanner.,1
878,4,"My ExpectationsAfter reading the information above I asked myself if it is necessary to write a review of Fistful of Reefer because the text delivers a lot of information. In the end I thought the book deserves some explanatory words.The cover did not give me a real hint except that marijuana and some folklore will be important for the story. But the use of key words like spaghetti-Western and alternate-history aroused certain pictures in me. And to be honest I was not sure if that was what I wanted to read.But prejudice is not reviewers best friend. I decided to read the book without any expectations except I wanted to have a good and entertaining time.ThemeBurden under all the action, the thoughtful passages, funny elements and crazy stuff it is friendship and the value of friendship which is the dominating theme. And it blossoms in the nearly heartbreaking moments which you find throughout the whole book.Even friendship is a very traditional theme the presentation is done in a refreshing way where stoned goats are only the tip of the iceberg.But one should not forget the side theme principles. I do not want to give away too much but I promise that you will easily detect the stickler for principles who acts strongly following the rule ""that which must not, can not be"".Finally it is also a book about racism. David Mark Brown found a way to combine friendship with racism in an unagitated an not overly didactic style. That means you will recognize racism if you are willing to.SettingAs you could read in the synopsis Fistful of Reefer is set in an alternate version of Mexican and American history around 1918. From my point of view it is well executed. recreates the sense of western and adds a mystery touch. David Mark Brown knows the landscape very well and use it perfectly for his purposes. You feel like standing in the middle of the scenery.The author shows his talent in the extraordinary well crafted action scenes.The flash-flood scene is outstanding. Don't drown while reading!Story and setting build an inextricably unit.I have one complain on a high level. I expected more dieselpunk elements.PlotI think it is superfluous to repeat the synopsis. I would like to add that the story contains some real unexpected twists and turns. Most of the time the reader does not know more than the main characters which is a detail I like. After a while you think you will know what will happen next. But I assure you David Mark Brown is always good for a surprise. Did I mention the goats?Character(s)There are four main characters which represent the themes described above.All of them are well developed characters which appear intense, dynamic and alive. They have personality and you take part in their development.There is McCutchen, an aging Texas Ranger who smokes ..... sorry I can't tell you moreThere is a trio of friends who try to make their living:- Muddy, an African American- Nena, a strong Native American woman- Chancho, a Mexican with a revolutionary pastAlong the story we meet a lot of interesting people who get as much attention as necessary to propel the story forward. Beside the human beings we have the ghost of Chupracabra and there are goats. Did I mention goats? And there are plants ....StyleThe style is flowing which leads you easily from page to page. The author has a good timing with arrangement of the different elements like action, depictions, explanations, dialogue. Partially the story is highly emotional which fits perfectly to the main them. And then there is humor. Be prepared to laugh out loud. Did I mention the goats?All in all the story is told light-footed and intoxicating at times with a sparkle in the eye and at times with tears in the eyes either from laughter or from sadness.The InevitableFistful of Reefer has been a surprising read. It delivers loveable characters easy to connect with (no, in this case I do not mean the goats), great action scenes, funny elements and unexpected twists and turns. This good mix of dieselpunk, western and alternate history lets time fly by.If you are looking for an unconventional, entertaining read with meat and you would like to get ""stoned"" by reading then ask your local dealer (of reading material) for a Fistful of Reefer!!!I look forward to read what will happen next in the Reeferpunk Universe.",1
879,5,"An absolutely fabulous read! I read this book in 3 hours!  This is one of those books that kept me turning the pages from the very beginning. Mr. Armitt has an extraordinary talent!Short stories - all cohesively written and whose characters are all somehow intertwined, makes this book, Entwined - Tales from the City a gripping novel.  My words to Anthony J Armitt when I had started this book and was about 43% of the way were, so far awesome..shiver..gape! Dark, gripping, certainly full of surprises and also misunderstandings.  Be ever careful of keeping secrets and ever mindful on whose toes you stomp - your demise could come knocking sooner than you think!  I am so looking forward to the next installment and I know it's going to be just as good as this one. I highly recommend this book.",1
880,4,"Naomi accidently goes to another planet thanks to a unicorn horn. Unfortunately, the horn doesn't come with her, and she doesn't know any other way back home, but that's not her biggest problem. That would be her brand new husband, and he's kind of scary. Her only hope is a crazy witch who knows something about catching unicorns. Which would be fine and dandy except, it's the crazy witch who interduced her to her husband. And then RAN OFF. She's going to get her for that.I absolutely loved this book. It was a freebie on Kindle and I was unsure of what to expect. What i did find, was a completely fun and addictive story, and I am dying to know what happens next!!!! Totally great book. Naomi's character is so much fun to get to know, as is the rest of the characters. Talking mice, killer crazy kangaroos, LOL. I want to read another one!!!!!!!!!",1

Hoping to escape the memories of her failure as a wife, she vows never to marry again, not even if it's Lukas North, her first love who's now returned.Lukas North is determined to reclaim the love he threw away ten years ago. He's willing to give Margaret time to recover from losing her husband, but letting her go is not an option.Margaret is wary of another long-distance relationship with Lukas--after all, it didn't work the first time--and when she discovers he's been keeping a secret, she panics. After the mistakes they made in the past, can their relationship be rebuilt on anything less than complete honesty?Can Lukas prove his devotion, and can Margaret learn to trust that both Lukas and God want only what's best for her?--My thoughts~Daffodils is a bight, sweet read about second chances from author Ms. Snow. I enjoyed this light tale and read it in one sitting. The characters are well rounded and I found the setting engaging... perhaps working as a substitute teacher leaves me partial to a classroom setting.:)I look forward to read more works by this author in the future.",1
882,5,"I enjoyed this book very much, so I gave it 5 stars. Full of suspense, I couldnt put the book down. Not a dull moment in this book, a page turner.",1

886,4,"It was hard to put this book down, as it was a cliff hanger from the start. Highly recommended for the intrigue.",1
887,5,Sexy love story with all the details.  Liked the juicey turn pager but wish they were longer.  I think the plot should have been drug out longer.  Make it a Steven King meets Gene Showalter kind of novel..... or I could be just wishful thinking.Story revolves more on the sex acts than the plot and characters.  So if you like a little erotica bring it on Tina Folsom.,1

891,5,"A few set of passengers of a crashed airplane were sent off in different directions to find help for the injured and remaining live passengers.  Glory and Jane were sent off in one direction while others went in another direction.  While walking they were suddenly approached by what looked like Native Americans on horseback accompanied by wolves.  They were scooped up and taken to their village while others were sent off in the direction of the crash to see about the passengers.  Glory was convinced that this was some kind of re-enactment of some kind when they approached the village and saw a bunch of teepees surrounded by Native villagers.  Wolf's Shadow knew instantly that she was his mate and took it upon himself to take charge of Glory.  Glory's character was a very independent, unique and strong woman.  She could not believe she had been somehow transported to the future by 50 years and had some arrogant, strong armed but quite gorgeous Native wanting her to be his wife/mate.  Until she meets her close friend whom she grew up with in the village whom she had just texted just before leaving on her airplane trip and she was 50 years older than Glory.  Crazy stuff, huh?  I think Glory took to Wolf's Shadow being a wolf quite well, although being a little drunk when she watched him shift but she wasn't about to put up with his 'caveman' tactics as to wooing her.This was a great story with strong characters and a strong story plot.  The whole series is quite unique.  Stories of terrorists blowing up major cities with nuclear weapons, meteor strikes and plagues in which one took out most of the female population left.  This leaves women as being a commodity and vulnerable to those who wish to get rich by selling them to those who have none, bride fights, wife abductions and all sordid stuff.  There is no law really except for the one's the individual populations make up to take care of crimes and such.  This is a great premise for a series.  I do have to warn you though that living in the world we live in now and looking how the future turned out in this fiction doesn't really feel like fiction and could possibly happen.  It makes one wonder at great thought about our own future.  I clearly recommend this book as well as this series and look forward to more.",1
892,4,I loved this series. i read this book and then had to immediatly buy the next two. the warriors are cursed into their namesake cyrstals. if they find their soulmate they have a chance to break the curse and be free of the crystals. the woman in this series are strong vocal independent but vulnerable. i love them. i cant wait for more in the series to come out.,1
893,5,"I really enjoyed reading Jaclyn's Ghost from beginning until the end.Wonderfully written and has a great story line.It starts out with Jaclyn waking up in her room to find a strange man named Logan standing there. She doesn't understand why he's there. She sees someone sleeping on her bed with the same designer shoes on that she does. She pulls down the covers and looks into her face. She's dead and doesn't understand how.A man named Charles comes and takes her to his office. He wants her to sign paper's so she can go back to hell (which he calls earth) and be born again. She really doesn't know what she should do.Logan told her not to sign anything.Jaclyn decides to find out who killed her and why, so she can go to heaven.She gets Logan, a human named Morgan, and some more ghost's to help her along on her journey. She learns about friendship, forgiveness, and love.I would really love to find out if Logan ever makes it to heaven and more about the other characters. 5-stars.- Crystal Newman, The Kindle Book Review.",1
894,5,"This sequeal was drama infused and hot! All the characters had some sort of drama happening even the supporting cast. By the end of Aiden's Game I thought Aiden was an a$$ and I was pulling for Pete. By the end of this book I was pulling for Aiden and thought Pete needed to man up and grow the F up. Daisy was annoying at times, heck all three main characters annoyed me at one time or another. But the story telling was so intense I couldn't put the darn thing down. Now I'm waiting for the conclusion to this saga. There's no way this saga can end with Aiden sitting on the truth about the paternity of Amy, especially since he is the father. I need to know what happened to Clara and JessieMae ( I hope they got their just desserts); Aiden's got to let Daisy know Amy's his daughter, and Pete needs to totally move on. A wrap-up is definitely needed.",1
895,4,"Liked the flow and that the slow parts did not stay slow for long. The fantasy and how it was put together way to go for the author. Also, thank you for making sex scenes believable.",1

897,5,"Harry's monologues are so true, poignant and sincere! What does an ex history College professor (who walked out of the system 20 years ago) can come up with (at the ripe age of 63) to make a living? But when he accepts, on behalf of a dying widow to investigate the presumed heart attack of her husband 10 years ago, he may not be ready to plunge into a whirlwind of danger, nor to team up with the spunky 38 year old grand daughter of the deceased...The life of a little town with its secrets, its characters, its power players, its Good Samaritans, easily permeates one's daily life with a love grip that doesn't let go. Cat's personality is amazing, and there is a total symbiosis between herself and Harry.A small excerpt: ""Life is simple when one has purpose. Purpose gives direction and motivation. One just takes action appropriate with the goal.""What one gathers very early is that all the examples of life style are excellent advice to follow once on the path of growing older in physical and emotional health. And outside of the grid, part of a community of free thinkers or too poor in old age, ""leftovers"" from society.The weather in New England must be frigid cold to require such an amount of wine to warm one's bones!The last line in the book opens all possibilities of alternate endings- a feast to behold while awaiting for the following installment of The Harry Neal and Cat Mystery. I had a great time. Will read more books in the series to dwell into the character of this interesting human.",1
898,4,"Short, sweet and to the point!  Despite how you may feel about the expatriate bar scene, I appreciate this Papasan character and his commitment to the girls under his watch.  I like his sense of justice and especially liked how he solved the problem of Perdue.Great story and a quick read.  Be sure to also read The Pull of Gravity, which is excellent!",1
899,4,"This is the second book I've ready by Mr. McDonald and I really enjoyed it.  This is quite a complex thriller, nothing is obvious.  The characters are complex, deep and descriptive as is the plot of the story.  The ending took me totally by surprise and explained the motivation of Sam Baker, which I questioned throughout the story.This was not a fast read as occasionally I had to re-read a section or two for understanding, but I found this novel facinating and can't wait to read another McDonald novel.",1
900,4,"2 very unusual, thought provoking stories... Both are about husbands that want to leave their wives. The 1st story ""Forever"" is about David who wants to leave Portia because she got fat and lazy after their marriage, and when he opens the front door to leave her, he stares into a black nothingness. Everything around their house was gone. The house was hanging somewhere in space. The second story ""Twelve Minutes"" is about Jude who wants to leave his wife Cathy as she is in a coma for over 2 years, but every day she regains consciousness between 6:12 pm and 6:24 pm, for exactly 12 minutes. He does not want to spend his life like this, having her aware of things around her for a mere 12 minutes a day.",1

I felt myself wanting to reach through the book and clack their heads together and say you belong together, that is how into the book I got.  You can feel the sexual tension from beginning to end and it was well worth the read!",1

905,5,"This is a book I got for free on my Kindle. To be honest, I didn't really have high expectations for it, but from the first few pages, I was hooked. There are so many twists and turns in the plot that you never know what to expect. A great read! Hope the author writes many more!",1
906,5,"Awesome book! I stayed up half the night, reading on my computer, because I *had* to know how it ended! I love how Shaw's female leads aren't typical heroines. Shaw's books are full of action and humor.This is the second book in the series, and it stands as a great story on its own, but you definitely want to readDestiny Divided (Shadows of Destiny - Book 1)first just for the background. Once you read Destiny United, you'll want to read the third book (we have to wait!), so you may as well know the whole story.I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.",1
907,4,The following review is my opinion and not a paid review. I got this book as a free download from Amazon.Crow is awaken during the middle of the night and runs out on the balcony. She's like what is going on? She looks off into the horizon and sees a big bright light. She runs inside and grabs her laptop and turns on the tv. She is searching the internet trying to find out what is happening and watching the news on tv at the same time.Then she is texting her brother trying to figure it all out. Crow's brother is telling her to get out as fast as she can that the dead is turning into zombies. Crow knows about zombies unlike most people in books or movies. She knows that she will need weapons and what kind of weapons that she needs to survive.I really liked how the writer portrayed the main character which is Crow in this book. She knew what to do. She knew how to protect herself. She knew how to fight the zombies. She didn't wait for some man or other character to take the lead and tell her what to do. Undoubtedly she has watched a few movies or tv shows about zombies.,1
908,4,This was a good story. Has lots of suspense and keeps you guessing about who the bad guys are.....,1
909,4,"This was a decent read for the money. I felt like the story ended mid-swing so to speak however. I would have liked a more solid end instead of just the abrupt end it has. Still, it's worth the read...",1
910,5,"In a nutshell, this book is about the ups and downs in the business of life as well as how it led to the ins and outs of Cyber dating.  Cherie, the main character, has an interesting road to hoe after life throws obstacles her way.I found the book informative on International rules regarding marital status, relationships, and matchmaking among other things.A note of warning, this book is not for the faint of heart or the Young Adults. It is a page turner that is best read in bed under the covers.",1
911,4,"Livy O Brien is a new and different person from when she was a pickpocket on the streets of Chicago. She's a Christian now and helping to run an orphanage. But when street children begin showing up in the small mid-western town she's living in, her past might catch up with her. And, now that she knows deputy Jake Russell, she really doesn't want that to happen. But, she cares for the street kids and has a desire to help them.Stealing Jake is a light, easy read. An historical romance with a touch of suspense, this is one of my favorite genres. I enjoyed the characters of Jake and Livy. The story was good. The suspense and action kept things interesting. Don't look for lots of depth, but this was a light, easy read that was very enjoyable. I will be looking out for further books by Pam Hillman.I received a free copy of this as an ebook for review purposes.  All opinions expressed are entirely my own.",1

917,4,"Very good short romance novella about Stephen, a high-strung romance writer, whose afternoon wrestling with the uncooperative (and bosom-heaving) heroine of his current work-in-progress is interrupted by Dave, the Adonis plumber who has finally arrived to unclog his pipes (in more ways than one.)It sounds like the set-up for a porn movie, but it's totally not. And even though there are eventual sexy times, this wonderful story is mostly a character study of Stephen and Dave, and their slow dance from irritated writer and easy-going plumber to something more intimate and meaningful.Vale's voice for both characters is *very British*, and there's a lot of great slang (some of which I didn't always understand), but both men's voices came off very strong and clear. I also loved that Vale slowly unravels both characters, so what you see initially isn't at all what you get in the end. It's sweet, funny, and exhilarating as new details are revealed, about the characters and also their intentions. (And boy, did I love the ending.)It's a fast read, but very recommended, especially if you're looking for something short but good.",1
918,4,"Suzie Schul is learning to love life again after her scum of the earth husband left her for her younger, prettier, pregnant sister. She owns & manages a sweet little B&B; in her hometown of Legend, Tennessee. Things are beginning to make sense again...until her latest guest shows up. The ever sexy, black shirt wearing, motorcycle riding, jet black hair stud from her 2 month fling before she knew her husband was going to leave her, Brad Matthews.The thing that I loved the most was that Brad was, as Suzie comes to call him, ""the man with a plan"" - he came to Legend to win Suzie back, to bring some life into their little town, & to fulfill his dreams. There were a couple of times where I wanted to smack him upside the head & say, ""What about HER dreams?!"" but I loved how it worked out in the end. Since it was a novella, there wasn't as much conflict or flip flopping ""should I or shouldn't I?"" which on one hand was refreshing, especially since they already had history, but on the other hand, I would've loved to see them develop a relationship a bit more fully before hopping in bed.Although I wish this novella had been longer, it is still definitely worth picking up with it's perfect blend of lust & romance, it was just what I was looking for!This review & more at RedHotBooks.com!",1
919,5,"Extremely interesting,  loved it...",1
920,5,I love this book. I seriously love this book. I'm going to finish this series no matter what and no one is going to stop me.,1
921,5,"Very interesting in its character development and plot line.  I found it compelling and delightful to see the possibilities of where the story might continue.  It may be fiction, buy is it really?  After all, with cloning and genetic manipulation real possibilities, why not the changes the story suggests?  Much of science fiction has now become science fact.  I anxiously look forward forward to the next in the series!  Well Done!",1
922,5,"This was a great read, a book totally enjoyed, mixed with fun in between the seriousness of the job. The story line was of great interest, easy to follow, and my kind of reading! You should make this one, one of yours also!!!",1
923,4,"Hitchhiker is a suspenseful, compelling read that really keeps the reader grasped on every word. It's simply written, but very fast-paced. I felt myself unable to put it down as I got further into the story. The plot itself had me hooked, like a serial killer against another serial killer? The concept is just really entertaining, and I couldn't wait to read more.I really enjoyed this quick, but satisfying story, but the only thing I disliked was that I wish it was longer because I really enjoyed it, and I wished there was a sequel.The bonus story was awesome as well, and I look forward to reading more from this author.",1
924,5,A good book about the American Civil War.Interesting to read as it tells you about the war from another outlook on things from a family's point of view of the war .It us diffrent to what I had expected,1
925,4,"This quirky little gothic tale is a five minute story of loss and forgiveness. A man is haunted by his amputated foot at Christmas. It's kind of fun in a weird way, so if you are looking for something to fill a couple of minutes, give it a try.",1
926,4,"First off...I LOVE Ms. Rai's books. This quick read was punched with witty dialogue, sexy descriptions, and a heroine I fell in love with. I'm a huge fan of mythology and this book was a joy to read. Hades's snake tattoo made my mouth water and the romance between Persephone and Hades is heart-warming and sensual. For a quick read, this book packed great character depth and an easy to follow plot line. I recommend this book for a quick, sexy read!",1
927,4,"This book explores the effect of real and unreal, crazy and sane.  The premise of a woman unknowingly living in a cursed home and experiencing a reality that doesn't seem to be in sync with life's reality pushes the reader to want to turn the page and learn whether the townspeople will come to better understand the source of her misery.  Much like ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" of years ago, this story will fascinate and frustrate, disappoint and intrigue.  The grim perspective is not attractive, but the writing is excellent and the ideas presented are fascinating.",1
928,5,I like having a couple of different versions of the Bible on my ereader.  I really want the NRSV cause that is what my denomination has as a standard - but it is not available for my kindle - or anywhere else this is not a bad version.  The formatting is pretty good - tho footnotes remain a problem,1
929,4,"This is a real review by a real reader (if you are interested in why I wrote that, see comment at bottom).While the initial plot developments stretch the imagination, once the book gets going the action is fast and enjoyable. There is a small amount of character development, enough to stop the characters from becoming cartoon characters, and a satisfying ending (requiring of course, a normal suspension of disbelief).Good beach or travel read. You probably wouldn't remember the book in a few months, but it's priced right and it slides down well.[It is too bad either the Author felt he had to hype the book with reviews of questionable origins, or that six of his close friends decided to review all of his 4 thrillers books, each one reviewing all 4 of their reviews on one day: bo on 4/28, th on 4/29, lo on 5/3, tb on 5/5, rh on 5/26, So on 6/7.]",1
930,5,"Zsadist is one of my favorite brothers----oh, who am I kidding, they are all my favorite because JR Ward is the BEST---so I was really excited to see that we get a continuation of his story in this novella.I was disappointed to see that it was only 96 pages, but as usual, JR Ward made every word count and it was an emotional, heartfelt 96 pages.  I think I teared up three times, and my husband kept asking me what was wrong.I'm no fan of short stories or novellas but I loved Father Mine.  I think it is the best novella I've ever read.Just One Gripe:It was just too short!The Best Thing About This Book:I liked seeing someone working through their problems in therapy.  I liked that the problems weren't magically solved by love.",1
931,5,"The storyline, and characters were very well done. There was enough action to keep it interesting, as well. The heroine couldn't stop herself from helping people, medically!  :-)",1
932,4,I really liked this book.  It really held my interest and the knowledge about cults was interesting.  I could see how some people could be sucked into a cult like this.....very scary!,1
933,4,"Lucifer's Daughter was a fast paced laugh riot and a charismatic father - daughter duo that are quite unforgettable. This mismatched father - daughter duo is what really sold me on to the series. I loved how Satan was a frustrated daddy begging his daughter to go out and be sinister and promiscuous. But as much as he grumbled about Muriel not being vile enough it's clear to the reader that he cares deeply for his daughter.The story itself was a bit predictable (at least for me) but it was very well written and I loved the relationships Langlais has created with her characters. I liked the aspect of the villains trying to over throw the devil. For paranormal lovers who are looking for something a little bit different from your standard vampire, werewolf or demon tales, then I would definitely recommend the Princess of Hell series. It's a fun, fast and witty read. You can't help but like the characters, especially the Devil himself. I mean seriously, for me to say that I liked the Devil in this story says a lot about what a fantastic story the author has created.",1
934,4,"I loved this story. Just about read it straight through, but sleep won out. This is a pretty fast-paced book with interesting characters. Bryce is the big sexy werewolf who, along with his friend Cheetah, an alchemist, break out of a research facility where they were being experimented on, taking the blind vampire, Lexis, with them.Bryce takes it upon himself to look after Lex and to help acclimate him to freedom being blind. Unfortunately, Cheetah parts ways and heads off in another direction, and we don't really see him again.Bryce and Lex are great together. Bryce helps Lex, albeit against Lex's wishes, to get back at the coven who betrayed him and took his sight.My only real problem and reason for shorting this the 5 stars was that the story felt rushed at times and I felt like information was being withheld. I woild have liked to see a bit more of their time before the breakout, and maybe some mire details about the individual characters. I would love to see these guys again in a sequel, perhaps one about Cheetah!",1
935,4,"*Note:  I always try to not write spoilers, but as book 2 there may be slight spoilers from book 1*In the first book of this series, Stella Mayweather learns that she is a witch.  She was moved from England to America to protect her life from witch hunters, she began training in her magic abilities, and she met and possibly lost new friends.  At the close of book 1 Stella is in hiding from the witch council, she is confused and alone, and unsure of what to do next.  At her new house, she befriends her neighbors, one of whom is the very sexy Gage who seems to be interested in her.  Just as Stella is getting comfortable in her new life, her past catches up with her, and a young witch in trouble is asking for help.  Stella is once again drawn into trouble with the council and left to question who is a friend and who is an enemy.I  really enjoy the Stella Mayweather series.  Stella is an easy-going, every day type of heroine.  She is a powerful witch, but she is new to her power and very humble.  She can be socially awkward and unsure, but she is easy to like and relate to.  In Unruly Magic, Stella is on her own for a good portion of the book, all of her friends from book 1 are unaccounted for, and Stella felt the separation.  She developed a friendship with her neighbors, and began to be interested romantically in Gage.  I love Gage, he's confident, sweet, loyal, and determined (and extremely good looking).  All of a sudden, Stella's old group of friends show up and turn her newly settled life upside-down.  Stella's friends don't ever really seem to think about Stella's feelings and her situation in all their witchy drama.  With the return of the friends comes more romantic entanglements and confusion for Stella.  I really did not like Evan much in this book, he is moody and possessive, and not in a good way.  I hope that as the series continues, Stella begins to stand up for herself more and not tolerate the slights shown to her by her friends and romantic interests.There was not quite as much magic in this book as there was in book 1.  There was more focused story line and character building though.  The magic that was in Unruly Magic was fun, and Stella continues to grow in her power and abilities.  The paranormal community broadens in Unruly Magic, and Gage plays a larger role in that community.With a well-written and developed story, engaging characters, and provoking romantic entanglements Unruly Magic is a very good read.  I highly recommend this series to paranormal and urban fantasy fans.  This is not a very dark series, but the paranormal and urban fantasy elements make for a great story and highly enjoyable reading.  I would recommend reading this series in order.I received this book for review from author.",1
936,5,"I bought a Kindle 1 from my friend. It allows me to enjoy books and preiodicals again with its large print and clear e-ink. It frees me from reading large print only on the computer.I subscribe to USA Today's e-Edition. It looks like the printed paper. I can save it as a pdf and enlarge the print. The problems are: there is more information in each daily than I can absorb, and I'm stuck in front of a computer.I prefer the Kindle edition  of USA Today. It is more concise, thankfully. It's easy to navigate through articles and sections, and so is a quicker read.It would be nice if the publisher allowed downloading editions I might have missed. Until then, I must keep the online e-Edition subscription for past issues.I am totally happy with USA Today's Kindle Edition. Thanks!Arthur.",1

Pell is NOT another genius like Ell Donsaii, but due to terrible circumstances, he is forced to think and observe and learn and therefore benefit himself and ultimately others. Fantastic story and I'd love to know more!",1
939,4,"I wasnt sure if this book would be my cup of tea or not.But it would seem that my cup of tea has been doing a lot of changing just recently.This is not your average romance, nor is it an ordinary fantasy novel.The tale that the author has woven is a totally engrossing one.Not only is it filled with an imaginative and colourful world but the characters are unique and intriguing.A lot of effort has been put into the world building and back stories for Crossover.The descriptions are rich, the characters are extremely likeable, and the relationships are believable.The twists and turns are exciting and the sparks that fly in and out of the bedroom between Hayden and Jasper are a refreshingly real take on a relationship (God knows relationships are never perfect!!)I have thoroughly enjoyed the first book of this series and am looking forward to reading the next installment.An enticing 4 Star read ;]",1

To be of status and have magic is taboo in the in 1800 England. Any person found out will have to either go through a specialized purging of magical sense or become an outcast.Allarde's story is written as a diary. Even though this story was short I felt the author did a great job in giving us enough information that we didn't have to read the first book and served as a great intro to the series.",1
943,4,"It's not a long read, but it packs a lot in.  Good, solid characters. Evil bad guys. Lots of action, in more ways than one. Story line is basic, but I did not guess the end. It was not rushed.Not bad editing, but it could have been better. Heads up: 'though' should be 'through'.  Misused frequently.I would definitely recommend reading it.",1

The newlyweds sizzle the pages during their honeymoon, while the murder and mystery begins close by.This tale twists and turns and keeps the reader engaged while the good girl and the bad girl find that not everything is so black and white. There are shades of gray. Good girls can be bad and bad girls can have a change of heart.This story reminds me of a delicate macram&eacute; piece. Each strand of the story is carefully woven and knotted together to form a beautiful piece of art. The well crafted story lines wrap around and lead the reader in a fantastic romantic thriller that you don&#8217;t want to put down.",1

947,5,I think this book was the best as it kept you in suspense. I did not want to put the book down. I felt this was better than Final Justice which follows this book about the continuing chase of the villian.  As far as suspenses M A Comley always meets my expectation of a good thriller.,1
948,5,This is a great piece of journalism. You learn about the serious and dramatic effects of the so called 'mild' injuries of war. The explosion wave of a bomb blast or the extreme fatigue and horror of combat can severely affect soldiers' life even when they come back home with no apparent wounds. Read it.,1
949,5,"Andrew Ashling's story telling gets deeper, more intricately planned and funnier. Be warned, my review may contain small spoilers. In the third book in the Dark Tales of Randamor the Recluse series, ""Bonds of Blood"", he brings in the Mukthars and their prince, Timishi. The Mukthars are the sworn enemies for which the the War Lord, Anaxantis, has been preparing. They are fierce, have bad manners and, of course, are sexy as hell.At this juncture, Andrew has made me feel like an intimate friend of the pages as well. Their story, while very light on actual combat, is clearly a major tactical play. I love to hear poor Obyann complain about his charges nakedness and their apparent love of each other's bodies. Andrew has funny and horny all mixed up with these guys and its a great combination.Finally, I must say that, typically, descriptions of battles either bore me or completely mix me up. Andrew's descriptions, including battle plans and maps, made the battle scenes come alive for me and I was totally able to follow the action. There was never a point where I thought --and a miracle happens here-- in order to end the scene.I understand Andrew has another series, or continuation of this series, almost ready for his loyal followers. Whatever it is, you can bet it will quickly find its way onto my e-reader and into my heart. Thank you Andrew, for the wonderful read and marvelous entertainment you've given me through your words",1
950,5,"I enjoyed this short story by Blake Crouch.  I have just rediscovered his works after first readingDESERT PLACESwhen it first came out in 2004 andAbandonin 2009.  Since I've blasted through all his available books/stories withRunbeing one of my favorite books - EVER.  I like Crouch's writing style - can you tell?""The Pain of Others"" was a great short story.  The premise has been used before - in other stories/movies but Crouch put his own little demented twist in it at the end.  The writing was crisp.  Letty was a unique ""heroine.""Keep 'em coming.",1
951,5,I received this book free in exchange for a review. I don't normally read through books this fast but this book interested me from the very beginning and I found I couldn't put it down! It was well written. The characters were well developed and the story just drew me in. I loved the little twists and turns as the story developed. It was exciting to be reading and thinking that you know exactly what is going to happen only to have it do an about face after the author throws in another little tidbit that fits so smoothly in the story and adds more intrigue. Loved it! I think this book would make a good LMN Movie!,1
952,5,"I love this trilogy, but this one is my favorite. The sizzle that is Cully and Jessa is AMAZING. Their romance was a lot of give and take, and it never felt like the author lost her pace with it. I'm so glad that I found this series, and I look forward to reading more by Patricia McLinn.",1
953,4,"This story is about Jake after he's recovered from his injuries and cleared of his AWOL charges as you read from the first book. His sisters are currently hidden in a safe house as they continue to track down Congressman Wharton.Jake meets Allison in Lahedeh who came looking for her missing fianc&eacute;. Now while I love Jake, I didn't love Allison as much. I thought it was a little far fetch to come all the way to Afghanistan looking for a fianc&eacute; whom she didn't love and feel for. Sure she felt obligated to find him but I just didn't really see the justification. No one in the right frame of mind barges into Afghanistan just like that. I thought her actions while trying to gather info were a little stupid and she was being stubborn for all the wrong reasons.Anyway just like Guardian Agent, this story was intense and packed with lots of actions. I was happy that at least Allison didn't get Jake injured or had the mission compromised. For this reason, I had to give this book 4 stars.I was gifted a copy in exchange for an honest review.",1
954,4,"If Lucifer is capable of true love, is he really such a bad guy? Misty Evans' Witches Anonymous series keeps teasing me with that question.  Jingle Hells is the second book in the series, and I'm having even more fun following Amy Atwood's adventures in the town of Eden, as she tries to resist Luc's charms and stay true to her vow of ""no more magic"".Amy's boyfriend, Adam the actual first man, is off on a trip to the Middle East to find the location of the Garden of Eden. Amy is lonely for Christmas, and her ex, that old devil Lucifer himself, would just love to worm his way back into Amy's bed, and into her heart. The fact that Luc really is thinking about Amy's heart makes me think that Luc isn't such a bad guy after all, which is a very strange thing to say about Satan. Even romantically speaking.But while Adam is out of town, Amy has a whole bunch of otherworldly visitors--also of biblical origins. For a girl who has already sold her soul to the Devil, Amy is suddenly receiving an awful lot of signs from the godly side of the street. First both Samson and Delilah burst into her ice cream shop wanting her to solve their millenia-old lover's squabble. Then two bands of angels arrive, one from above, one from below. And get this, it's the so-called ""good"" guys who want to keep Samson and Dee apart! And then there's this cat...and Luc arranges for a delivery of the Bible, with instructions for Amy to read Genesis, just before Adam returns from his trip.If you read the last book, you might remember that Amy's sister Emilia started everything by getting luring Luc into her bed. Well, she's back. And it's all her fault.Java Brownie Chip ice cream is the cure-all for breaking up with your boyfriend. There's a liberal application of it required in this story.Escape Rating B: This is fun stuff. I like Amy. She's someone I'd want to have coffee with. Or better yet, some of that ice cream of hers. There was less of her Witches Anonymous group in this story, which was too bad, because some of them are hilarious, but more clarity about the folks in Amy's personal life. I liked the backstory on how Amy met Luc, and where Keisha (her partner/coworker) fits into things. Adam's role was much clearer.Gabe, AKA Gabriel the manipulative Archangel, made a cameo appearance. He will clearly be back as the man/angel of mystery.Emilia got off just a little too easy. She needs to feel some serious guilt and remorse for the mess she caused. I hope that comes in the next book, but right now, Emilia's story feels a tad unfinished to me.I like Luc more everytime he shows up. Which goes back to my original question. If the devil feels true love, how bad can he really be? Just bad enough to be really, really good?",1
955,5,this book really brings the fire..if you are a fan of mrs. daniels she does not disappoint in this book. and i loved how this story was written..can't wait for more,1
956,4,I enjoyed reading this book. It was an entertaining read in which you didn't have to think to hard and it kept you reading to find out who did it. When I finished I looked up the second book and was glad to see it free as well and am now on that one.,1
957,5,Great short story to give you the creeps. All Harmon's books give me the heebie jeebies and this one was no different.,1
958,5,"Sorry to say I just finished Uncivil Liberties. I'm sorry to say that because I really, really didn't want it to end. It took me a while to finish it off because I knew I was near the end and just simply didn't want to part with it knowing the next in the series was not available yet. I'd read and ponder all the happenings going on and speculate on the finish. Soon I'd be back to the book reading another chapter because I couldn't stand it. Then I'd find something else to do for a while, again because I didn't want it to end. Back and forth, back and forth.Once again, a fast paced book but still with excellent development and great depth on all characters. Yep, most all the characters from the first book (""State of Rebellion"" - read it before this one) are still there and have involvement. The plot thickens deeper and deeper.I don't want to say much as I myself try to avoid reading reviews that give away some of the story but this is an excellent read. It's just as good as ""State of Rebellion"". Mr. Ryan is able to captivate me, my imagination and this book really makes me seriously ponder current world events and all the possible ""truths"" behind what may seem like the truths out there. Naw, it's not some big conspiracy book like a Jessie Ventura work but at least for me, it really makes me think about current world events and how they might not always really be as they appear. With the background of the author, he'd be the type of person who could use his knowledge of military and politics to create a realistic plot ... and he does. Often I see in reviews for several ""Indy"" authors that their books are filled with grammatical mistakes. I'm not great with grammar as you can tell from my rather plain reviews but Mr. Ryan's books seem to be just as good as any high-dollar book out there. When it comes to story plots and excitement, I think he's tops!Of course reviews are most often our personal opinions and perceptions of a book despite how well intended we are in trying to be objective but I did notice one review on this book that felt ""Moderates and, especially, liberals will have difficulty wading through it. Mr. Ryan covers a political spectrum from merely conservative good guys to bad guys who are neo-con crazies."" and I respectfully disagree with this. I think if you are far leaning ""left"" maybe you could equate to the previous reviewers opinion but I've seen good and bad from both parties in both books and I feel Mr. Ryan does a great job presenting the story as most can identify with. There are do-gooders and villains in both political parties. I suppose you could feel the same way if you are a far leaning ""right"" because not all Republican characters are always in it for the right reasons either nor painted in the perfect light. I think most everyone would see this as believable and realistic.I am so tickled to have come across this series and can't wait for the future novels of this series. Keep `em coming!",1
959,5,Beautifully written.  Amazing characters.  Heart warming story.  These books are amazing.  i found myself tearing up over the passionate dialog.  LOVE it!  Thank you Ms. Linstrom!,1

963,4,"Simple writing, compelling store.  My one complaint is that the author uses the word ""simply"" to much.  A suprising page turner though!",1
964,4,Ok I loved this book until about 40 percent then I was just angry and then I loved it again.---spoilers---Ok so I was hooked from the beginning and thought these 2 were so awesome together. Then a part I don't like is it skips to 10 years later.  Ok for one I don't like that it skipped that much time and second how can you feel so strongly for someone but never in 10 years speak of those feelings?? Ok so on to my biggest problem with the book.  The king is pretty much tricked into marrying someone else and yet will continue to sleep with Lassen too.  I see this as a huge betrayal and I don't like cheating in books and that is how I see it.  I know this is apparently common in this timeframe however I still don't agree with this.  For one thing the king explains that he knew they were soul mates before they met and if he knew how much he meant to him how could he sleep with someone else?  Let alone marry someone else?  This just doesn't make sense to me and it cheapens the deep relationship between them.  Also I think Lassen should have been more upset about it and not fallen right into his arms the very next day after the king 's marriage and consummation.  I tried to get over my personal problem with this part and once I did got lost in the story again and I did enjoy it a lot from when Lassen conceives until the end.  All in all this was a great book.  Well written and keeps your attention until the end and the sex is absolutely awesome!!!!,1
965,4,This book picks up where the first left off but also introduces some new characters and how they survived. All of them are interesting and add to the story. can't wait to see how it all turns out...,1

971,4,"I don't know why but I'm always surprised on how well these erotic&#8217;s are crafted, how the sex just flows seamlessly into the story line. Before I got into these I always thought erotic&#8217;s were just adult books, meaning they just had sex added into them. Nothing more than that. Just an added bonus for the adults out there. But now I see erotic&#8217;s are different from adult books, I see they're two different things really. Adult books just have the added bonus but the erotic&#8217;s have a well-placed steamy scene that help move along the storyline. And I absolutely love that. Absolutely. I just can't get enough and my favorites are of course paranormal.Anyways, where I'm going with this is that this is another well-crafted erotic and I want more of the tale. The storyline is very original and for most of the background story it felt like a fairytale. You know, &#34;Once upon a time&#34; feel to the Demons and Fae's history. From the very beginning I was hooked and this feel made it so much more intriguing. It was definitely unexpected and I loved that!I also loved how slowly but surely we learnt about Amara's past. Okay, it wasn't slow because this is a novella but the bits and pieces were placed perfectly throughout the story, we were never bombarded with her history. Which is another thing that readers will love because you'll just crave to want to get to know her. It's one of those past where you're just dying to know, dying to know why she's become so cold and emotionless, but it&#8217;s also one where you're afraid of what might be hiding in the shadows.And with the help of Vetis, Demon of Corruption, we're able to have courage to go chin up in those shadows as he breaks down Amara's wall as he shows her that she can have pleasure after all. With Vetis you can't help but swoon and for me (like I'm sure with most women out there....hopefully) when I read these I always seem to imagine my significant other. My man and let&#8217;s just say it makes the books that much hotter haha. Sorry family members.....but come on, I'm sure y'all know by now haha.Now, I read a reviewer didn't like this cause they fell in love after sex, but its more than that. Plus, they spend like three whole days together haha. Him trying to get to know her and him wanting to show her another side to the sex world. She too later finds out more about him when she finally breaks down her walls. But anyways, what I'm saying is from Amara's view point this is the first time she's ever gotten a gentle touch from a man and we all know if ones been abused for so long and they finally experience a gentler person they of course fall easily for them. Vetis&#8217;s point of view is that he just wants to protect her from her evil bastard of a husband. Damn gambler &#62;_&#60;. So in my eyes, they fell in love in a different kind of way. But we all have our opinions.Overall I devoured this and I just couldn't put down my tablet. Though I'm not giving this five bats because there were some edit problems and the ending, well I wasn't totally satisfied. I felt like it ended kind of suddenly, maybe not, but I wanted more of the war between the Demons and the Fae. I guess my lack of satisfaction is because the sequel to this has different characters, so I'm kind of afraid that the powerful subplot of the war is going to be shoved to the side. It'll just all be rehashed to us, no real movement into it. But I hope I'm wrong and the awesomeness of this author's storytelling will shine through.Forewarning: when reading this make sure your husband, boyfriend, or lover is nearby as there is major foreplay in here that you&#8217;ll just be dying to try&#8230;..especially if you love chocolate ;)",1
972,5,"The Sword of Sophia is set in the postwar landscape of Vega 3. The planet has been ravished by war. Its people are demoralized and oppressed. Three years of occupation is slowly changing the once peace loving, liberal planet into a brutal clone of Sirius. The Sirian government forces a policy of indoctrination on Vega. This policy involves slavery and systematic rape. Rape is made legal, and the male population, who had once been taught to revere women, is encouraged to abandon the old teachings of Sophia, their female deity, to embrace the new ways of the occupying regime. After years of brutal occupation, the once Jewel of the Galaxy"" starts to sink into a depraved and violent society.During the war Erik Norgaard had been a Vegan Guardsman, one of his planet's elite fighting men. After the war he was just another ex-POW trying to reconnect with his family and friends. However, he found his home and his people corrupted and changed. He'd fought to defend his planet; he'd put his life on the line to preserve his planet's way of life. The war had failed, now his battle would begin.The Sword of Sophia is yet another great book from author John Bowers. John really manages to put across the hopelessness a person would feel when under the heel of an oppressive regime. That feeling of despair would be enough to drive some to great acts of heroism, or terrorism. The line between the two depends on which side of the line you stand. This is such a compelling book, I highly recommend it.",1

I would read it in a heartbeat.Escape From Southern Point by Libby SternbergI'm so angry at the groom I could spit.  I loved this short story.

976,5,"My Review:This book had everything that I love in a good romantic suspense... a really evil bad guy, a great couple with lots of sexual tension, well-plotted suspense with a few twists and surprises, and a wonderful HEA.Lilly & Braden were high school sweethearts, but she broke off their romance suddenly and unexpectedly 10 years ago. Braden never understood why and has never had the chance to see her and find out why it happened. It's obvious from the very beginning that there was more to their breakup than Lilly ever admitted to and 10 years later both these two still have really strong feelings for each other.There's a lot going on here. A year ago, Lilly was undercover and her team was captured, tortured, and most of them murdered in Africa. She is still dealing with the PTSD from that so when she sees someone stalking her, she thinks that it's just an effect of PTSD hallucinations. It turns out that there's a serial killer on the loose killing women in Braden's life and the killer definitely has Lilly in his sites.As sheriff, Braden has no choice, but to move in and spend all his time with Lilly so that he can protect her. It's a well-used story arc, but that's because it's so effective. I love it...you know all those unresolved issues are going to come to a head when two people are forced to spend time together 24/7.They may have been kids the last time that they saw each other, but that chemical spark is still there for both Braden & Lilly. Even more importantly, their friendship is still an easy natural thing once they get past their hurt feelings and awkwardness. These are two people that just ""fit"" together. I really liked the fact that Lilly has had such a traumatic last year. I think that it gave her character a vulnerability that was believable so that she could lean on Braden maybe a bit more than she would have normally. That closeness was needed to help make the sparks fly between these two.The suspense was really good. I had an idea of who the bad guy might be just from an inference made early in the book, but he is so incredibly evil and creepy...it makes for a great suspense line with lots of twists.Overall, I just really enjoyed reading this book. It captured my attention and wouldn't let me go until I finished the book (which just happened to be WAY later than my normal bedtime.) An absolutely fabulous read.",1
977,4,"I gave the Craig Kennedy collection four stars, catering to those who like forensic investigations when the science was in its infancy. Actually, I liked the Thorndyke stories better. His cases are more believable, better written, and the characters are developed better. I read all of the books in this volume and enjoyed my time. Still, the procedures are a bit tedious since as a rule they are pretty familiar to most readers. Forensic science has progressed so much more, but if you like this period of history, you will enjoy Thorndyke. --Dr. William H. Stephens, retired editor",1

979,5,"Burly and Grum are two unusual creatures. Burly is a talking bear who is very large and very friendly, and Grum is a groblin. Groblins are quite unique and well, green.In this story, Burly and Grum and their human friend Max start their day with a nice picnic by the river but decide to go adventuring to find the secret city. However, in the middle of their fun comes danger and Grum's brothers come to join the adventure.I read this aloud to my four year old and he thought it was a great adventure. It is a chapter book with some pictures, but not very many. For younger children this makes a great story to read aloud, while it is also a great beginning chapter book for a more accomplished reader.The chapters are well organized and the language is easily accessible. The problems that the characters have to deal with are portrayed in a way that makes them easy to discuss with a small child. For each dilemma there is a clear good and poor choice which the story presents and it gives parents a great opportunity to discuss them with their child.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this story and so did my four year old. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves the Hundred Acre Woods stories because it has the same feeling with a bit more fantasy thrown in.",1
980,5,I love this cookbook!  Much healthier than what I eat now.  I really need these recipes!  Very happy that the author decided to share this with Kindle owners for free.,1
981,5,"1st in the series, I picked this up looking for a different author.  I was pleasantly surprised with a great mystery/thriller with well developed characters, lots of action, a little romance, and a great story. I found the Denmark setting really made a difference.  I would recommend this book and the series to anyone looking for something different than the usual Patterson, Woods, Sanford, etc.. settings.",1

983,5,"This book is surprisingly emotional.  A far cry from your average student/teacher fantasy, these two connect on a level that goes well beyond a simple spanking.  The Dominant is patient and intelligent and the submissive is lovable and full of life.  This was worth the cost.  I'm excited to read the sequels.",1
984,4,"Don't normally read books about angels but this on stood out for me the story of the three men and what the each need made me want to read it. They each have their own story line in there on way and together it works as one, and you get the sad before you the happy ending.",1

So off to Panama City for couple days of fun and sun with her best friend Kat. But things go from good to weird after encountering a stranger her first night there. Who is the mysterious stranger and what does he want with Nicole?I don't usually read short stories...they are always just too short for me. But Blood Awakening seems to be a good lead in to the next book Burden by Blood. It gives enough to peak your interest and have you looking forward to book #2. I am interested in finding out what is up with shady, scary guy, what he has ""awakened"" and seeing what develops between Nicole and Nick. Burden of Blood will be out by August or early September.",1

992,5,"I finished reading ""The Return: A Novel of Vietnam"" several days ago and in the interim have finished two other shorter books but the characters and the story of this one stay in my mind.I had no problem getting into the narrative within the first couple chapters but then it bogged down for me in the military details of the past -- my problem, not the author's.  That only lasted for a few chapters in which I skimmed through parts that I couldn't or didn't care to understand.  After those parts I couldn't put the book down and resisted the urge to click to the last chapter to see the ending.  I stayed up reading far into the night then most of the next morning to finish the story.The character development and the location descriptions put me right there as the author alternated between the past and the present with the story being told in flashbacks.  At several points I felt myself tearing up over the death of one of the characters that I felt I had come to know.  I was very happy to see some of the characters from the past making it to the present and helping to bring the story to conclusion.  Although this is a work of fiction, the names of places and battles are real and will be familiar to anyone who has lived through the Vietnam era.I haven't read any of this author's other books but will definitely look for them.  Aside from some editing problems mentioned by other readers which were not terribly distracting for me, I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a hard-to-put down story.",1
993,5,"Amazon Kindle offers four Inspector Zhang short mystery tales for free or 99 cents. This is the free one. The somewhat humorous story takes place in Singapore where Zhang is a police detective. Singapore is a country which is tightly controlled by its government. Murderers are executed. There has only been one serial killer in its history.An American is killed in a five star hotel and Zhang is joyous. Few police officers have an opportunity to investigate murders in Singapore where no more than one occurs in a year. This murder is even more interesting because it is a ""locked room mystery."" The proven facts are these: At 8:30 the American entered his room with a prostitute who left at 9:30. At 9:36 the American ordered room service. At 9:45 he spoke with his wife for about five minutes. At 9:59 the waiter came with the room service food and found him dead. The door and windows were locked. No weapon was found in the room. The outside of the room was monitored by TV and no one entered after 8:30 other than the prostitute and the waiter. Zhang expounds at length about the seven ways that ""locked room mysteries"" can be committed and he delightfully solves this case.",1
994,4,"I was not sure what to expect. I have an ipod touch and i like to read books. When i purchased them through Iceberg Reader (I-tunes book reader software) i did not have enough variety. I was surfing through amazon and realized they offered an application for the kindle so i bought random free books to see what it was about. This was one of the books. Very different and very steamy. The story is short and i read it in like three hours. This does pick up where the first book left off and leaves you kind of hanging. I have not read the third book yet so i am not sure if it will pick up where this one leaves off. Overall it really is a good story.  ( i dont give any information about the book because i think you should read it for yourself, it is free after all. Although i think i would have paid for it now that i have read it.)I will say that the Sex Scenes are not as graphic or strong as they are in the first book. The story outside of the sex is really good.",1
995,5,"As with all the Kate Jones thrillers, I enjoyed this.  It is a little unbelievable but still thoroughly fun to read.  Keeps your interest and the characters are good.",1

1001,2,"Just a sad excuse for a short teaser story and an introduction to the Molly Murphy series. The young girl makes these ridiculous jumps to conclusions that the reader can't even begin to understand due to the lack of evidence. How the character made her assumptions, that she believed to be right and to solve the ""mystery"" is not made very clear. And given the mediocre writing, I'm not sure had it been much longer of a story that the writer could have accomplished showing how the character made her leaps in the first place.Although there was a teaser chapter included with the free download, I didn't bother. This was supposed to be set in the late 19th century but it does not read as such whether in the way the characters speak, nor in the attitude of the characters. It appears that aside from a pretty cover this story did little to encourage further reading. Thank goodness it was a freebie for the kindle!",0
1002,2,"The writing in this book would normally get it a higher rating - if not for the main character. As far as being someone who draws you into the story, this character is a spineless and imagination-challenged loser. Is it possible the writer is a delicate and overly sensitive female?",0

1004,2,"I purchased this book because I was excited that it was about a teacher.  Well, please folks, don't judge all teachers intelligence by Cathy in this story.  She would forget her name if it wasn't typed out so many times and her complete inablility to figure out just what was happening to her really got on my nerves.  She gets away from the bad guys by pure, dumb luck.  Her overall stupidity had me pulling for the bad guys.  It did end well with her finally deciding to ""grow up"" and I guess that's what it was all about, coming of age.Don't get me wrong I love MS Ball's books usually and have found the Raine and Cisco series to be really good and Sancuary was great.",0

1006,2,First of many possible books.. Told from the make point of veiw.  But also a finding lost love story.  Not terrible,0
1007,2,"This story was very interesting and presented quite a number of real twists. I had not heard about this crime befor as some commentors remarked.  If I had I would have been totally disappointed. Though I enjoyed the story I feel it is very short and really was not worth the purchase price.  This is my first ""foray"" into the ""Kindle Single Program"" and it was somewhat negative.  Will try a few others before finally deciding it this will be a worthwhile program for me.  Right now I don't think so!",0
1008,1,"I found this short romance unbelievable and dull.I'm not sure how the two main characters fell in love.  They only knew each other four days and they hardly spent any time together.  Attraction I can understand.  Love just didn't make any sense.Unbelievable can be overcome in a romance, but this was just very dull too.  The characters were just so good - unrealistically, relentlessly, unceasingly good - and nothing much of interest happens to them.Maybe if this had been a full length novel the author could have made the love story more convincing, the characters more than one-dimensional, and inserted some action or real conflict.  There was conflict, but the resolutions were telegraphed so explicitly to the reader that you never feel the impact of it.",0
1009,2,"I'm not going to beat a dead horse about the French lesson needed for this book so I'll move onto the odd verbs used and stiffness of the plot.  Like the other reader, I was sort of bored and pretty much skimmed this.",0
1010,2,"The author,  Wells Hastings (1878&#8211;1923), gives us a snapshot of life during the early 1900's. Much of the time you wonder why the characters are doing what they do. The romance was not developed enough before the Professor made assumptions about his relationship. The whole thing was a little odd to me.",0
1011,1,"I'm clearly not the target audience for this story.  As other reviews have noted, it isn't really a ""crossover"" story designed to appeal to adults and children.  The narrative is barebones, there is little wordplay or cleverness to entice the adult reader into enjoying this simple story.  The story itself is pretty repugnant.  A girl doesn't feed her rabbit and the rabbit goes on to grow to huge dimensions and eats her parents before the girl stabs it in the ""butt,"" cuts her parents out, and they slaughter and eat the rabbit.Part of what made this story so unappealing to me was the muddled nature of the events taking place.  The rabbit bites fingers, the girl doesn't feed the rabbit for a couple of days, the rabbit complains that nobody loves him/her.  It was difficult to understand why the author was throwing so many disparate elements into such a short tale.  As a feeling person, my sympathy is with the rabbit who wasn't loved or fed.  Yet the author presents these acts as a matter of course.  I wouldn't want to share such a tale with a child.  The rabbit's end was so gory -- I can't imagine sharing this tale with a child who was young enough to still be interested in the simple style.",0
1012,2,"So I really never write a review, but I feel compelled to write one for this book because I had so many mixed feelings while reading it. The book starts off with Erin accidently coming upon Dalton and Cade encaging in some very steamy interaction. She is confused because she cant look away and then Dalton turns and makes it known that they both know she is watching. Feeling embaressed she runs so fast out of the motorcycle garage (Dalton's work/home) and drops the drawings for his shop (the original reason she was there for). So I get she was embaressed, but then we go into pages and pages of her debating what to do. The men were nothing but patient with her, to the point where you just wanted to shake her and say ""get a grip!!"", you have 2 hot men who want to add you to their already steamy sex life, which includes BDSM, something she is not familar with at all. It just seemed she was being babied by them, and it got extremly frustrating.Cade and Dalton were amazing I loved them, I almost would have just like it better if it was just about them and left her out of it completly. Which says a lot right there.Bottom line, it was just ok. Would I recommend it as a good M/M/F book? No. Only because of my feelings for Erin, and how they were so back and forth, it made for not a very enjoyable read.",0
1013,2,"I was impressed with one aspect of these headphones: the way they fight and STAY in my ears. I have odd ears, I will be the first to admit, not much stays in them in the way of ear buds. These had a great fit and stayed in my ear without feeling like I was trying to shove a foreign object down my ear canal. However...they fit so well they then become heavy on the base. I've played with fitting and size of the pad that rests in my ear and not a lot helps. I like the fact that the cord can be wrapped up out of the way, but it's not user friendly when you just want to get it out quick. I used it with my Kindle Fire to listen to it read a book to me...worked well and I enjoyed it. But like I said, the sound quality is not 100% there.",0
1014,1,This book was very bad. It was so bad that I feel that this was 1 of the worst books I ever read. #illogical  person: something magical happened :),0

1017,1,"I saw this was a freebie and decided that since I'm loosing nothing I'd go for it. Despite having paid nothing for it I still feel like I've lost something in this deal, maybe the 15 mins it took to read this were more valuable then i first though. Anyway, I found this repetitive and boring to, and if that wasn't enough there were numerous grammatical errors and typos that made my eye twitch.",0
1018,1,"This book is.... so disjointed and bad I could not finish it. I got 80% thru it but got so disgusted with the contradictions in the characters and unbelievable character interactions.  This is book is so bad there is not a single thing that can be built upon to improve it, the combat is unrealistic, the so-called survival skills smack of a hobbyist and not a dedicated one at that, for they are often wrong, the personal interaction and magic is so unrealistic and contradictory that you need to just accept anything. There is no consistency,  well except for being consistently bad!",0
1019,1,"I've read quite a few of these types of menage books and was not pleased with this one at all. I felt no connection to the characters and didn't really understand/believe the attraction between them. If I could, I would go back and not download this book at all. I actually had to re-read Something New, Coming Full Circle and Destiny Calls to remember why I liked this genre in the first place.",0
1020,1,I am simply stunned at the ineptitude of this author. Get an editor!  I am shocked that I was able to finish this book...must have needed to justify spending the money on this carp.,0

1023,2,"Generally speaking I prefer if someone has a negative opinion they should keep it to themselves, but WOW this one was weird.  It was difficult to read and in some places I felt like the author was trying too hard to use words they might have discovered in a dictionary.  I get the feeling this author might be from another country (just a strange way of stating things).  The ending was a little bit of pleasure and a lot of pain.  I was confused by the fact that one woman had to drive the car - he parked at all the stops he made, so why did she have to drive?  The contraption they used was interesting, but made me wonder if there is such a device for folks that like sexual pain or was this the author's imagination at work?  Hummm...don't know.  The premise was interesting, but I'm thinking this author needs more time to develop and study before publishing (there is some potential there).  The other reviewer stated that this was a very short story...I'm sorry, but it wasn't short enough for me.",0
1024,2,"I'm sorry, this book starts great, developes in a somewhat engaging manner and ends terribly, I think the sign of a good writer is it's ability to conclude a book, this is not the case and is a shame, personally I wouldn't buy this book again, nor I'll reread it and prolly will not follow the author others works......and yeah it kinda pisses me off, cause this book is also LONG!!!",0

1027,2,"The plot didn't really make sense to me. It just all went too fast with no real depth. The author also uses grammar that isn't normal in every day English, words like sullied and whilst. There were a couple others but she uses whilst a lot and it was irritating because it always tripped me up. The Tribe name could've been something easier to pronounce also since its used 2 or 3 times a page. I like when a story is able to be read smoothly. But overall if you want something to read it's good and it is free! The one really good characteristic of this author is the erotically descriptive romance scenes.",0

1030,2,"I've read a number of Eve's books and they have all been a bit goofy, but in a good way. She writes likeable characters, highly imaginative story lines, and hot interludes ... usually. In this one, the characters are okay, but the story feels like a hastily contrived fairy tale with obligatory sex scenes thrown in. Everything is so easy, it's anti-climactic. The moment the heroes meet the heroine, they're committed to her. They smile at everything she says and does and tell her, &#34;If you need me, just make a wish.&#34; Crises are too easily surmounted, and she's so special that everything just falls into place. The story tells us she's had a raw deal and a hard life, but it doesn't feel that way.I also didn't enjoy the menage scenes. They felt rushed, not sexy.",0
1031,1,"Don't get me wrong. I like a lot of Stormy Glen's book but this one is definitely a miss for me. Sasha was suppose to be a mischievous and lovable character, I found him annoying at best.

1032,1,do not even begin reading this mess!  I am a longtime fan of Mr. King.....back to the publishing of Carrie.....and I am sick that this stuff was compared to his brillant work.  I got it for free and I feel cheated so at least do not pay anything for it!,0

1035,2,"Confusing, badly edited and repetitiveI got 5 books from this series when they were free for the kindle. I will not be buying any more. I've read 5 books and while I enjoyed the first 2, they are fast going down hill. The plot is repetitive; save Maria, find shelter, and no progress is ever made. The characters keep having the same arguments and making the same bad decisions again and again. The sentence structure is awful with words missing or misplaced as well as lots of wrong word choices (passed instead of past, they're instead of their). It is also confusing trying to figure out which book goes first. Chronologically speaking, it seems like ""Villains of the Apocalypse"" should be first. It appears to follow the scientists as they are creating the OZ ""zombie"" virus. The Secret Journal has a part 1 and 2 while the other books are numbered 1 through 4. Maybe the author wrote a prequel and found out they were addictive and just kept writing one more prequel? It doesn't help when most of the books start with a scene and then go back to tell you how they got in this sticky situation.The description on Amazon is a bit vague. Here's another one.Three scientists have developed a virus intended for use as a weapon. They are testing it on various groups that no one should really miss (refugees, terrorists and people smugglers for example). There is a containment breach in the Australian Outback and in a short period of time, the country is overrun with zombies. A media blackout meant to control panic and prevent the story from getting out also keeps most of the world ignorant of the disaster. Most of the story is told from Rebecca's point of view, she is an average 16 yr old girl. Other main characters are: Maria Marsh (another teen with an immunity to the virus), Jack (Maria's boyfriend), Kim (Jack's older sister and a police officer in Sydney) and Kenji Yoshido (Rebecca's 19 yr old boyfriend and a marine sniper). The entire focus of the series is getting Maria Marsh out of Australia to the doctors who will hopefully create a cure.There is a lot of running around Syndey and the Outback trying to escape monsters, looking for transportation, shelter, food and water. You also have religious fanatics sacrificing women and children to the zombies, mutant animals, giant zombies, and rogue nanobots that are animating machinery. I almost forgot, Kenji can see and talk to dead people.",0
1036,1,"I downloaded this on the spur of the moment in a vain attempt to entertain a 2 year old.  Well, it didn't work.

1037,2,"One of the things I love so much about paranormal/fantasy novels is their amazing attention to detail.  Worlds beyond comprehension are created and characters, with otherwise impossible abilities, are summoned up from the imaginarium of the authors mind.Now, all that being said I was pretty excited by the idea of a ""paranormal-magic tracking"" private investigator, unfortunately having a fantastic idea doesn't always equal great execution.For those of you who have ever watched a film noir  or noir shorts you will easily understand the format for ""Tracking Magic (Max Killian Investigations)"" Here was a novel that was written as a series of short stories which are (when you break it down) actually case files for the PI Max Killian, (a somewhat blase' middle-aged investigator who -to be honest- makes a brick wall sound exciting.)After Schnieder's 1st story ""Haunting Clues"",  (which I thought ended abruptly and had no substance) I was certain things would get better... there was just so much potential there, but instead of getting better, (expanding the personal attributes of Max or even bringing in references of older cases) the stories just...stayed the same. They were (in places) mildly entertaining, but the obvious repetition in the beginning of each story ( yes - I get it, you don't tell people you can smell magic because then you will be taxed by the government) had me tuning out.Would I count ""Schnieder"" out of the writers talent pool? No... she just needs to focus more on where she wants her ""Hero"" to go.Do I think ""Tracking Magic"" is worth the time? Well since it only took me 2 and a half hours to read, sure... I'm just not all that sure I'd want to pay $2.00 for that 2 hours.Read if you have NOTHING else.Happy reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: The IRS eventually finds everyone.. there is no point in hiding... they are like a bad case of Ebola with no vaccine.",0

It seemed like she had a crush on her;the character wasn't fully developed.I couldn't quite figure out some of them. However, in spite of all of this, Jordan's character was consistent and likable.

The characters were flat, lifeless and completely drab.  This belongs on an erotica forum site for people to post their sexual fantasies.  It is not even remotely close to being worthy of being called a book, short story, or even ebook!My only consolation comes from the fact that I downloaded this while it was free on Amazon and did not waste my money on this badly written smut fest.Do not waste your time or your money.You will regret it.",0
1044,2,"So very bad.  Shallow writing, shallow characters, shallower plot...  I am glad so many enjoyed it but this wasn't worth the time I spent reading it.

There is a very weak plot, that being that the women are related Mother and Daughters. The writing style has no finesse! The language used is often crude, in fact I can think of nothing to recommend this story at all. it's just about sex. The characters are all shallow, I disliked them all. The ending which is supposed to give us the HEA, is nonsense. I certainly will not be reading more from this author.",0

1050,1,"End of the world as we know it.  I tried to read this book made it about 24% before just giving up. The End of the world has not been more poorly thought out in many decades.Example: (paraphrasing) The bad stuff is air born, here is a mask, go get tested. He gets tested, there are two choices, you are either infected already or you are immune, there is no third option. Mask is pointless...The main character has no redeeming qualities, there are no scenes that have not been done (much) better in books and movies dozens and dozens of times. There is nothing that makes you want read, except you keep thinking. wow three book series, there must be something here.  If there was it was after I got tired of the pointless, stupid story.",0
1051,2,This book was really awful. I have read a lot of zombie books and this is one of the worst. Save your money. If it were free it still won't be worth reading.,0
1052,1,Endless chatter.  Unresolved plot points.  Not remotely entertaining.  The rambling narrative was annoying and served no purpose other than to make it a challenge to finish the story.,0
1053,1,"This book had a good premise - a retired KGB agent sent from modern Russia to kill a member of the International Monetary Fund.  Unfortunately, the premise was the only good thing about this book, as the characters and situations were simply implausable.  Just before an important vote, a US IMF member is killed by faulty brakes on his brand new Lexus and despite the police being surprised, the incident is treated strictly as an accident! Even the new widow is unbelievably stoic about her husband's death and is more interested in planning the funeral than grieving or questioning. Coincidently, his brother happens to be a retired CIA operative and he alone is suspicious.  Even when a second member of the IMF narrowly escapes a terrorist-style bomb and the brother tries to impress the importance, do the US authorities seem somewhat interested.  Where's Homeland Security, the FBI, even the CIA?Without giving away the whole plot (although it wouldn't be a loss) the story moves to Russia, where the brother, his gutsy girlfriend and the original KGB agent team up to right all wrongs.  The few interesting looks into today's Russia are dwarfed by the repetitive, angst-ridden political intrigue.  If we heard a certain politician was ambitious and ruthless once, we heard it several times.  The chase scenes were yawn-worthy and I found myself paging through to find something of interest.  I kept reading to see when the US would finally show up!  They never did!What a waste of a good premise!",0
1054,2,"I read a lot of sci-fi and fantasy.  I did not manage to finish this book.  I found it slow starting, clunky, and the characters were not engaging enough.  The first chapter was fine, but after that, it just went down hill.  The book switches narrator from character to character and doesn't give you enough time to know who everyone is before it moves to the next point of view.  The author shows promise, and I would give him another try in the future, but this book was not for me.",0

She travels to the deserts and befriends a Shoshone Native, who helps her unravel the mystery.  I was interested in the plot line when I picked the book up.  However, the author's writing style completely turned me off.  She jumped forwards and backwards in time with disregard to keeping the plot moving.  She also used a lot of cliche sounding phrases, which after a while became annoying.  I realize this is a new author, but she definitely needs improvement on story development.",0
1058,2,This book features a handful of 19th century style riddles in which the reader is asked to guess what the object is that's described in a series of brief verses. The genre will be familiar to readers of 18th and 19th century novels.There aren't very many riddles nor are they of the best quality of the genre. The format prints the answer so close to the solution that it's almost impossible to read the riddle without seeing the answer.,0

I usually read 2-4 books a week on average so only getting halfway thru after 2 weeks is very uncommon. I only persisted in trying to finish it because of all the glowing reviews.I enjoy a good build-up like anybody but, it should keep you engaged. I fell asleep EVERY TIME I picked this book up. The insignificant & redundant information just bored me to tears. For example, how many times must the type of a &#34;swivel chair&#34; be mentioned?? Ugh. And referring to something by a name & not explaining what it meant until chapters later, really? Why?I saw other reviewers likening this book to Stephen King, unless they meant Tommyknockers (SNORE), I'm not seeing it.I don't usually review books I find unfavorable but I felt a need to fill in others so they don't come away feeling like I did.

I am starting to believe something I read once that half of all the reviews that are posted are fake.  This is the second book I bought because of all the great reviews, and both books turned out to be terrible.  This book isnt really ""science fiction"", it is ""science"".  If you want to know all about plants, and I mean pages and pages and pages all about plants, then by all means read this book.  If you want an interesting story, then read something else.

The people do not behave realistically, the whole ""hippie commune"" thing is implausible, I just don't know what the author was thinking.  In particular, the sub-plot between Jimmie and Julie is plain idiotic.  She gets tired of some of the people in the group, so she just ditches Jimmie and drives into the chaos?  Get real.  Again, what was the author thinking?  RJB.",0

I found the writing to be a cross between a bad Disney channel sit-com and a bad porno movie. The description mentions cheesy - yes, it is.I realize that Samhain titles are steamy and if a title is marked as erotica it will contain sex scenes. That wasn't the problem. I've read some good erotica and sensual romance. There are plenty of well written titles to pick from. This wasn't one of them.Vivi Andrews has a few other titles that are getting much better reviews. I will give her another try.",0
1067,1,"This book had pacing issues, no plot development and no sense of setting. Shakara was given a background that made her seem strong and capable, but her actions in the story never fit who she was supposed to be. Cade went from jackhole to creeper in an instant never, ever coming across as desirable. The sex scenes (I refuse to call anything to do with this book ""love"") were just gross. The constant ""baby girl"" never fit either character. Do they make eye bleach?",0

For the younger generation, this is probably what they want, but for readers looking for a good ROMANTIC mystery, this isn't it!  I liked the storyline, but not all the graphic sex.  I prefer a romance to build a while before the characters get sexually involved, and the sex doesn't need to be so graphic (or take up half the book).  Save a little for the imagination.",0

E not let the human know about the vampire . So then why the hell did Lawson told Tanya within the first meeting that cosgroves is a vampire. If Tanya is so tough then why the hell did the Russian lost the war in Afghanistan? I can write a dissertation on what else is wrong but I don't have the time. Just skip this.,0
1072,2,"This is an update of my original review...The content of the Kindle version of WSJ is very similar to what you would find getting the print edition delivered.  There are some things missing such as stock quotes but that's ok because it's easier to look up and read stock quotes and such on the web.  The format makes navigating the paper a bit cumbersome.  Graphs, photos, and other graphics are poor in the Kindle format.  It helps that this subscription comes with WSJ Online and iPhone access.  WSJ Online is very good and the iPhone app is terrible.  Not only is the content via the iPhone app incomplete, you have to put up with ads!Considering the new cost of $21.62/month or $.072/day I think the cost for electronic format is way overpriced considering its deficiencies.

Just not this book.,0
1080,1,"I was extremely disappointed when reading this book. From the description, I was expecting and hoping to read a fictional story which formed a social commentary about the pain women have to deal with after being raped, particularly women in the Middle East, where rape is seen as being the woman's fault. The whispers and comments I expected to be the focus of the book were found on a grand total of four pages. The rest of the book was an odd mix of a rushed romance story and a drama about a woman using deceit to further her career at the expense of another. Even more out of place was the main male character going completely insane near the end of the book, though all of the characters seem to view his extreme and illegal actions as being perfectly ordinary.I feel that comments do need to be made on the horrors rape survivors face. I'm sad to say that, despite the description, those comments cannot be found here.",0

1084,1,"Coulters&#8217; Wife is a novella length romance.  (Please note where the apostrophe is in that title.)  Holly is &#8220;married&#8221; to three brothers, Ethan, Adam and Ryan.  The four of them live in an isolated location in the mountains and when the story opens, Holly is very pregnant with their first child.  She is upset because she wants to have sex, but the brothers agreed no more sex until after the baby comes.  The plot basically revolves around Holly getting the brothers alone and seducing them one by one.  When Holly goes into labor early, the brothers must work together to deliver the baby on their own.This book was creepy on so many levels.  I don&#8217;t really have a problem with m&eacute;nage relationships, but brothers???  That&#8217;s just icky.  Then, they live up on this mountain semi-isolated from people&#8230;this is how bad religious cults are formed, not sexy love stories.  Add into the mix that they are bringing a child into the world whose family tree will go in circles and the hair on my arms prickled.

1085,2,This book drags!  I am a patient reader but this book drags and takes forever to build any kind of relationship between the two main characters.  Add to that the slow trickle of information and you have the making of a slow and apathetic romance novel.  Will not read the series.,0

This one was less thought out and gradual, but still was as hard-hitting (pun intended) as the Prima. I am not sure that the characters are meant to be hated or admired in anyway, because they don't actually do anything. If the book was supposed to be about a developing relationship between Thomas and Tria, then there was very little emotion to sustain it and because nothing actually happens in these books, there is no redeeming moment in them either. They are not the worst books written so they don't deserve the lowest rating but because there is nothing uplifting about this story, it stays at 2 stars for me.",0

For a short read, I felt like it was a complete story.What I Liked: I really liked the angels and specifically poor well-meaning Norman.

1096,2,"I don't like to write bad reviews...but this just had to be said:This book was bad!  It had the possibility to be pretty good but the execution wasn't there.First of all it seemed like the author just took a little bit of vampire lore from every vampire story there is.  Which wouldn't be bad in itself, except that I felt like it was almost a parody at times.  Kinda like that movie ""Vampire's Suck"" that makes fun of all the vampire movies.I REALLY, really, really, did not like the ""heroine"" of this story.  I don't even like calling her that. She had no depth, and was a spoiled, self-centered, vapid young girl.  She had no brains, and might as well have walked around with a sign on her neck saying, ""Here I am come kill me!""  Her character is really what made this book awful.Here's the story:Brian is a vampire and lives across the street from ""the girl of his dreams"".  (I think this exact phrase was used at least 10 times in the story, although I really think it must have been nightmares!)  Besides the usual vampire powers (strength, speed, agility, and mind control) he can dream walk and spirit walk.  He's pretty obsessed with Heather (the girl across the street).  He basically stalks her dreams and follows her around in a spirit walk.  The book starts off where he is spirit walking and follows her to an abandoned home where she and her friends like to party.  Heather leaves the party just as men in suits come to haul all of her friends off.  (We don't know where.)  Brian ""suggests"" that Heather come to his house so that he can keep her safe.  Their journey begins as they try to escape the mysterious agents who have been tracking them down.  The weird thing is that they aren't after Brian (because he's a vampire), they are actually after Heather (although I don't know why, she could make anyone want to just gag her and put her in the trunk).I felt like Brian was a pretty accurate description of a teenage boy- hungry all the time and thinking about sex when he wasn't eating.  I really never understood what he saw in Heather except that she was beautiful.  (Which again, would be true to form for a teenage boy).This is not something I would want my pre-teen daughter to read, because of the way that the female lead was portrayed and some mild sexual content.",0
1097,2,You may want to spend your time reading another book.This is poorly written and dull. Only made it thru afew chapters before I deleted it. It was free butnot worth my time. SKIP this one. There are thousandsof well written books and better ways to spend your time.,0

1101,2,"Two stars because it was a good concept, however I felt like English was a second language for the author. Very stilted brittle sentences. The love scenes were not very smooth needs more. Keep at it though this was close,and a good idea.",0
1102,1,"The writing and dialogue was awkward and very juvenile.  It was almost as though the writer had been given this story as a high school writing assignment.  It really felt like reading a 9th graders idea of what a sexy story should be.  I had the feeling that the writer had a big thesaurus out on her desk to look up some of the weirdest descriptive words I have ever read.  ""Oral Channel"" for mouth?  Huh?  I kept getting yanked out of the story by some of these strange words and stiff and unrealistic dialogue, as well as situations.  At least it was free.",0
1103,2,"I was given a free copy in exchange of an honest review.I don't know how to put into words my thoughts and feelings about this book.It could have been a much better reading if the story were longer and the author had given us more time and many more details about everything. The characters, the evil lurking out there, anything useful to make us understand better the evil one's intentions and motivations. It wasn't very clear why he went after Lana in the frst place. It was like I started reading the book by the middle of the story and not from the beginnning.It also felt too rushed. How the story unfolded, how Cole and Lana's relationship developed. I didn't even had time to really connect to the characters. And I was annoyed by how easily they both got angry when things didn't go how they wanted. Like spoiled children.I started to like them toward the end. Actually, I kind of already liked Cole from the beginning, but he still annoyed me a little at times. I started to like Lana toward the end mostly.The story would have been very good if better developed. The plot was interesting and intriguing. I also admit that I enjoyed some parts, and especially some HOT parts of the book. And I kind of liked how passionate and ""hungry"" Cole was with Lana. But it lacked some things that would make me rate a book 3 or more stars.It only reached 2.5 stars in my opinion. And I'm not even sure I'd read the next books in this series. I'll have to think of it.",0
1104,1,I had a hard time finding it sexy and with as much bed hoping and clownish behavior going on I some how found it all just a bit boring. I was disappointed.,0
1105,1,"This book is truly remarkable. I'm not sure whether to give this to a scientist to dissect or a priest to exorcise. I have never seen a book so ungodly boring. It seems like the author wrote too much and it seriously wreaks havoc with the book. Most of the dialogue is exposition with a little character building shoved in wherever it would fit. From the situations that occur and the way they're handled most of the characters come off badly, with few redeeming qualities, and as awfully boring. I can't even remember their names.  As for the plot, what little of it there is revolves around a curse placed on the children of 2 families to cause conflict and a war, thus removing any responsibility the ""good guys"" might have in that horrendous affair. However most of the plot is shoved aside for world building, and while that may be fun for a bit, it gets old real fast. Another thing the more I learn about this world the less I want to read on, It is that unpleasant. There is nothing charming, magical or even realistic about it. This is by far the worst book I've ever read and the only barely redeemable thing about it is the opening. If I could give this zero stars I would. I'm sure this could be used as a form of torture in some circles of hell.",0

I'm starting to think that all the ""give the ebook away free so we can get buzz going"" should stop because 9 outta 10 times the feed back is bad. The writting was very choppy and the story reminded me of one of many sci/fi B movies I've seen.",0
1107,1,This story is not even worth 20 words of a review. I was expecting way too much from these authors. But sometimes you get what you pay for and I will look more closly at the book details before purchasing. Super Turbo Charged fast~paced book. A good story outline could of had more details to make it a good book.Will look more closely from now on.,0
1108,1,"I read about 25% now, and there's still no hint of any romantic interest from any main character. Other than that major disappointment, it's too mundane and slow most of the time, with too much redundancies and things that go without saying, as if written for slow-wits.",0
1109,2,Just thought it was too dumb to suggest to anyone else.  I asked my husband to read it and he had the same thoughts.,0
1110,2,"Unfortunately I can only echo what so many other reviewers have said about this book: although the premise is good, the execution of the storytelling leaves a lot to be desired.  While the opening page and a half of the book is reasonable in terms of grabbing attention - setting up questions in the reader's mind, the following three pages of blatant exposition quickly cools whatever interest was roused for the plight of the two women stuck in the Nevada desert looking for the illegal horse round-up.The book would have benefitted much from an editor's eye being run over the text, followed by a good deal of hard thinking about what to keep in, and what to remove.  The dialogue feels forced and stilted, and in some places kept in merely for the sake of having dialogue, and the recurring instances of exposition - of telling, rather than showing - what is happening do not help to improve the overall impression of the story, of nor the authors skill at telling it.It is a shame, because it could have been such a good book if handled properly.",0
1111,2,"I was very frustrated by this book. For one, it was hard to handle that this girl who has spent years not caring much about her appearance can undergo a makeover in one day and come out looking so stunning - it's talked about all the time, how hot she ends up. Also, the whole ""Bachelor""-esque TV show just got hard to read about and the writing was very choppy. I ended up reading until about 50% and then skipping to the end as it was that annoying for me.",0
1112,2,"This short story had so much ridiculous and cliche stuff happening in a short space, it was almost impressive.A brain tumor leading to an imaginary friend, the wife of the main character just happening to hook up with the serial killer the main character has been hunting, the serial killer's motivation being transparent mother issues . . . it was just beyond belief.  Maybe if the author had taken more time to present halfway believable things happening it would have helped us suspend disbelief, but we were just taken from implausibility to implausibility with lightening speed.",0

1114,2,"Ok hmm.  I was excited about this book.I read it cover to cover so to speak .. in about 35 minutes.Bleh.Being the second book in the Jane Porter series, this picked up right where the first left off.Jane is a woman who was celibate for 2 years.  Apparently she is ""insatiable"" .. at least until Antonio awakened her desires.  In this book, their passionate D/s relationship has been enhanced by Santos, Antonio's best friend.  Yadda yadda ..It is one thing to write a series.  It is one thing to write a series of short novels.  It is a completely different thing to write a book that contains only a few scenes; most of which by the way, were your normal Joe Blow.  Seriously?I love this story.  I look forward to reading more.  The next book in this series, Reinventing Jane Porter is now on my kindle awaiting my attention.  I'm pretty bummed though.I like this author a lot, but if I can only look forward to 30 minute stories that cost $2-$4 .. I'm not sure it is worth it.I suppose I can recommend this MATURE book to adults only.  Strong sexual content.  Duh, right?  The length is very disappointing.  I'll let yall know about the third book.  If I write that review today .. I'll be totally bummed.",0
1115,2,"It took a fair bit for the author to get this book started.  The author tried too hard to establish his characters and I am afraid that it didn't work too well.  From my perspective the characters were very shallow and unrealistic.Many of the scenes the book just didn't feel right and some &#34;over the top&#34;.Got more interesting towards the end but I had already worked out &#34;who dunnit&#34; early in the book, no twists in this tale.",0
1116,2,This book came free so I am grateful.  It was way confusing and the characters came out of the woodwork so often and with so many names that I gave up trying to keep track.  I couldn't finish the book but I wish other readers better luck.  Sorry Melanie Nilles.,0

1118,2,"Smith is a fabulous writer, but in CHOKE ON YOUR LIES, he tries to do too many things at the same time. It begins with the protagonist, college professor Mick Thooft, seeking help from his old friend, the morbidly obese Octavia VanderPlatts, when his wife tries to cheat him out of his house (in a fashionable part of Minneapolis) in a divorce settlement. Pretty soon things get really complicated, but Octavia has a plan to solve Mick's problems while punishing his wife at the same time. Unfortunately, the portion of the novel doesn't deliver the great climax we were expecting because Smith is only half-finished at that point. Pretty soon there is a murder and other legal problems and once again Mick needs Octavia's help. Whereas Smith's superb novels YELLOW MEDICINE and HOTDOGGIN' are non-stop, well-done action, CHOKE ON YOUR LIES is a bit of a meandering mess. It definitely has its moments, and the characterization is good--with the notable exception of Mick, who is a bit of a wuss. Along the way, Smith shoehorns in too much other stuff, such as opinions about Minneapolis and Vietnamese food, and pretty much anything else that appeared to be on his mind, including name-dropping a few bands and songs.Still, there is enough going on here that I don't feel like I wasted my time. I look forward to reading Smith's other books that I have in my collection. But this one definitely could have use some strong editorial guidance.",0

1120,2,My 6 & 8 year old boy and girl did not like this book. I wanted to like it but it was a quick delete...,0
1121,2,This book has a great start but it fades fast.  There were so many grammatical and spelling errors that it took too much effort to try to figure out what the author was trying to convey.  The main character caused most of her own troubles.  She was frustrating and whiney.  It's a long story that could have been told in half the time.,0
1122,2,"Beautiful Demons is the second book by Sarra Cannon I have read. I didn't love the first one, The Trouble With Goodbye, but I realized I already had this book, and in some reviews for TTWG the reviewers stated they liked this series much better, so I thought I would give it a try. While I did like it better than the first book, it still wasn't amazing. I will, however, read the second book once I get through some of my library books.Beautiful Demons starts off with Harper being sent to another foster home. This is her last chance. She knows there is something different about her, but she tries to keep that secret for good reason. She accidentally started a fire when she was younger, when she gets mad things move by themselves, just things she doesn't know how to deal with. Shadowford Home is a strange place, but she is determined to make it work.Her first day of school she sees them - the cheerleaders. She had run into the star quarterback when school shopping, but once Drake found out where she lived he couldn't get away fast enough. The whole school has an obsession with the cheerleaders. They all want to be them. They are the most beautiful people in school, and date the cutest guys. Harper makes enemies pretty quick with the queen bee, but tries to stay out of trouble. She doesn't understand all the hype with them. Sure they are pretty, but so what? She also has some strange things happen to her in her first few weeks. She faints when she walks by the demon statue on her first day! She has strange dreams and people act odd. She knows something is up with the town.Harper does become friends with one of the girls she lives with, and has a huge crush on the guy who lives behind their house (the one caretakers son), Jackson. There is the instant connection with Harper and Jackson and he is trying to keep her safe. She wants to know what is going on in the town, but Jackson cannot tell her. He does his best though.Now up until this point in the book I was really enjoying it. Then one night Harper has a weird dream, is sick for a week, and when she wakes up she cannot remember what has recently happened. She can only remember a little bit of her time at Shadowford Home. The cheerleaders starts being nice to her and trying to be her friends, and Drake starts talking to her like he wants to date her. Harper, after only like 2 minutes of what is going on, is suddenly drawn into their crowd. I didn't get it. Well I got why she was, but it didn't actually seem like she was different. The writing didn't make her seem like she would suddenly want to be a cheerleader, when before she was scoffing at them. I wish it would have been more like she changed, or something made her change, to make her just forgive Drake and be all yes! This is what I want. I just didn't see it. You could still keep the moments where she thinks something is not quite right, but I didn't see her actually changing enough, or being lonely enough and wanting to fit in any way possible, for her to be trying out for the cheerleaders.Then you don't really find out what is going on in the town at all in this book. It is a pretty short book, and you don't really learn much. Hopefully some of the secrets will be revealed in the next book. It wasn't horrible, but the second half was kind of a let down. I just wish it would have been more obvious that Harper changed, instead of having her be basically the same but not. We shall see how the next book is.This review was originally posted to Jen in Bookland",0
1123,1,I read the first book in this series and thought okay I'll give the second book a chance. I didn't care for the first book but I finished it which says a lot for me when I don't care for a book. I didn't like the main female character at all. I liked the two male characters so that is why I gave book two a chance. No more for me.,0
1124,2,This story annoyed me from page one. it got 2 stars instead of 1 because the grammar was decent. the sex scenes were stupid and boring and the plot was idiotic. don't waste your money.,0

1126,2,The love angle is not really believable. She kind of relies on love at first sight a little too hard,0
1127,1,Nice story thoroughly spoiled by mis-spelling and poor editing.  It was a an effort to get through every page.  Real shame,0
1128,2,"This is a ridiculous book. The billionaire hero, out for vengeance, falls so fast for his first victim that he barely takes a single breath after meeting her before making a play. The exotically beautiful heroine, a totally innocent pawn in a game she doesn't understand, falls for him just as fast. Within record time, they're making love everywhere possible, with a brief nod to the current fad of domination. But Alex doesn't forget his thirst for revenge and - you guessed it - he comes to believe that the Asian woman with stiletto heels is secretly betraying him and his company. I guessed the villains almost immediately, skimmed the tangling tongues and multiple orgasms, and got through to the happy-ever-after that marked it as an entry in Romanceland, complete with forgiveness all around. If you like books with ridiculous sub-plots (winning a baby?) and extra-tall, extra-broad-shouldered men matched with petite women who somehow have unusually long legs, you won't mind this.",0

Thankfully I did't spend a lot for it, however, I would be just as annoyed had I paid 99cents for it.But I did purchase it in spite of the fact that there was only one review, and that reviewer wrote same crap for each of the writer's books. I blame myself for not researching the reviews more thoroughly.The formatting was just awful, it was eye straining.  Add that the story was dull, dull, dull.  I couldn't finish the thing.This I'll delete from my Kindle.",0
1130,2,"This book was good. I would've liked more history on the ""magic"". It was mentioned frequently towards the end of the story, but really vague. For that, I gave it 2 stars. I wanted to know about the relationship of the lead female and her parents. Again, they're mentioned, but that's it. This book has a good foundation but seriously lacks in the character development area. The chemistry between the lead characters is believable, but there's just not that much there. Good free read, glad I didn't pay good money for it.",0

1137,2,"--from Red Adept Reviews--I received Aboard the Unstoppable Aerostat Fenris (The Steam and Steel Chronicles), by Cameron Chapman, as a review copy submitted to ""Red Adept Reviews"" by the author.Overall: 1 3/4 StarsPlot/Storyline: 1 1/2 StarsA steampunk romance that's shy on steampunk and nearly absent on romance, this novella-length story answers essentially no plot questions and feels like Act I of a three-act novel rather than any sort of stand-alone piece. There is a sequel available on Amazon, for those who want to read the second installment, but it takes place four years in the future.Numerous plot details enter the story, then are abandoned, including an entire chase scene whose outcome must be inferred from the fact that the main characters are alive to discuss something unrelated in the next scene. The story's backdrop is a massive intercontinental war, but its combatants are never identified (outside the blurb), leaving the story drifting loose from its anchor in time and place.At one point, the characters agree to transport some mysterious cargo. While this decision fuels much of the rest of the plot, it turns out to be a mere plot device. A ""no questions asked"" employer fails to disguise the gaping plot hole any further than his re-entry into the plot, leaving the second half of the story feeling forced. The mysterious device itself raises several questions that are never answered.Though the ending left many loose ends, Isabelle's quest comes to a happy ending so quickly that it reads like a fairy-tale.Even die-hard steampunk fans will probably not enjoy this story as much as they think they will, and romance fans will likely be equally let-down.Character Development: 2 StarsThe main characters came with good background. Stig's in particular really piqued my interest. But the main thrust of the story involved the two characters' interpersonal interaction and dealings with current events, so their backgrounds were tangential at best. Stig didn't feel selfish enough, if that makes sense. For a man who travels alone, has a history of violence, and occasionally flies on the wrong side of the law, he was unbelievably solicitous to the runaway girl he found aboard his vessel. At one point, this grizzled veteran of numerous sky battles can't even concentrate on outrunning air raiders because he's daydreaming about the girl.Most of the characters' thoughts about each other were repetitious as they tried to resist their attraction to each other. Little progress was made throughout the story, despite opportunity, leaving them much the same place they started.Writing Style: 2 StarsThe way steampunk details are used in this story makes me wonder if it's the author's first venture into the genre. Words like ""brass"" and ""gas"" are tossed around, but deeper details, those which make one feel that one cannot be anywhere but smack in the middle of a steampunk tale, just aren't there. The aerostat Fenris itself gets no outer description despite its prominence in the story. When an untrained character must land the airship on a distant island, it involves a dial and a lever, and no turning.Too much of the action is told instead of shown. Filler sentences occur regularly. Wordiness is a problem in some areas, and a lack of detail in many others. Dialogue was unremarkable, when it should have been distinct: Isabelle was from Britain and Stig was Scandinavian, but both spoke with ordinary American word usage.My inner geek discovered that the author misused the term ""einherjar"". You may not know what it means, but Stig certainly should, since he's using it to explain part of the old Norse belief system of his ancestors.I did notice some hilarious confusion regarding the thoroughness of pirates who threw victims from their airships to their deaths far below: ""Sometimes it was after their throats had been slit, and sometimes it was before."" Think that through for a moment. I didn't mark off for this; it rather paled in comparison to other issues.Editing: No ratingThere were only a handful of small errors in the story, but we don't give bonus points for average editing.",0
1138,2,As I read I kept hoping it would get better and I would get hooked but I finally had to put it down about 1/4 of the way through.  I couldn't finish reading - I just didn't like it.  It was too modern for me.,0
1139,1,"Maisy tries to be a good Christian girl but says things she shouldn't and winds up pregnant by a gay friend.Perfectly horrible book, with no similarities to actually trying to live a Christian life.

1143,1,I was not impressed with this book and do not recommend it.  I was expecting more but I was highly disappointed.,0
1144,2,"I think I must have read a different book to the other reviewers. I bought this book after reading the reviews and seeing that it was rated 4 1/2 stars and I was disappointed.  From the very first, the main female character came over as foolish and empty headed. How in one breath she could proclaim that she was aware of the matters of the world and still get herself caught in the most silly situations is beyond me. She displays not innocence but really just a lack of common sense throughout the book. And this is obvious since it took six or seven men contantly watching her every move to ensure she did nothing silly during her outings.  The male character Taylor is really only a tad better but definitely an improvement of the female lead.  I do agree with one of the other reviewers that this book comes over as being written by an American ...it needs a rewrite to ensure it fits into the time period in England that it purports to be set in.  Notwithstanding the above, it does have a good plot.",0
1145,2,"I love Kris Cook books. I have read them all. That is why I was really surprised by how awful this story was. There was nothing to it but hoakey sex talk( which has rocked in all the other books but was awful in this one, it was so B movie in this story) and not really any kind of story line to follow. Maybe it was a quickly thrown together story, but if I had read this without knowing the author I would never have believed it was Kris Cooks work.I'm just glad this was not the first story Ive read by this author because it would have been the last. I hope nthe next one is back to normal.",0
1146,1,I read these three books on a trip. Would not read another. Found plotting and characters simplistic. No humor. Bad guys went from invulnerable to vulnerable in an instant. Thought it strange in an organization fighting the supernatural they had no real supernatural allies.,0
1147,1,"I would have liked this book more if Jessie wouldn't repeat her thoughts constantly and if she didn't come across as childish and winey. It seemed that during and after every catastrophe Jessie was thinking of sex with Colton, typically while your being shot at you aren't getting turned on. After the fore mentioned shooting, Colton leaves her at her parents home and tells her to wait for him to return to guard her. what does STUPID do, she sneaks off. At this point I stopped reading she deserves to be gutted in an alley for her stupidity throughout the whole book. I feel bad that Colton would be saddled with such a nut job",0
1148,2,"Not bad, worth the ninety nine cents. Somewhat far fetched but what historical romance doesn't have a portion of that?",0
1149,1,"My goodness, what a horribly boring and ridiculous read.  The only consolation is that it only cos 99 cents.  I only got to  51 percent, and stopped because I could not tolerate it any longer.  I have read many conqueror books from 1066,and this book was like a comedy compared to this.  Not that there was  anything funny about this book, it just seemed like a poor attempt at writing a book about this topic from the author's part.  Perhaps as p as the author was trying to write a book about Norman conqueror's that was not the usual norman conqueror children as characteristics, and if that was the case, she failed miserably because norman conqueror's usually consummate the marriage ASAP after they are wed to the vanquished bride so that they have greater claim to the land.  But this norman hero seems to suffer from some ridiculous mental flaw, that he does the contrary, only because he wants her to care for  him first.  That's fine if  this this was a typical medeival romance book, but this is a norman conqueror who was given this land and bride as conquest.  This story was totally unrealistic for this era and I was really disappointed with this read.  I suggest that the author researches her history as for this particular era, then attempts to write a book about  and,make her next book about this era as nd the norman conquest more realistic.  I would not recommend this read to anyone who is accustomed to reading adveinturous, romanticNorman conquest books.  THIS WAS A JOKE!!!!!!",0
1150,1,"Like others I purchased this book based on the 5 star reviews...but to say the least they are beyond misleading.Where do you start a review on such an appalling piece of drivel?The short version: the book seems to have been written by someone on heavy drugs who fantasizes about evil corporations taking over the world, and dare I add a spolier to one section: bestiality.The book has no overriding narrative nor plot, and wanders aimlessly as if the author was experimenting with a new drug while writing each chapter.The mark of any good future/ sci-fi based book is that it should be believable: and this book is about as believable as the idea that Kim Ill Jung will win the Nobel Peace Prize.Don't waste your money.",0

He and his fellow Circs want to know why she did what she did and if she is a spy, they want to know that too.  What they don't realize is that the woman they are looking for isn't a human; she is a Circ as well and she is about to experience her first change.Book 3 of Marie Harte's Circe's Recruits, Derrick is a bit of a disappointment.  First, I found it hard to believe that Sabrina and Derrick cared for each other.  I couldn't sense any feelings other than hormones between them.  Derrick's feelings for Sabrina stabilized the farther in the book I read and that helped some.  Sabrina's feelings were off; she kept constantly trying to leave knowing full well she would be brought back again.  My second disappointment with Derrick had to do with the storyline revolving around Sabrina accepting Roane as her alpha.  I read the first installment. I KNEW Roane was mated so what Sabrina had to do to show submission to him angered me greatly. I almost didn't finish reading Derrick because of it.  That single scene ruined the entire book and I know I will not read this novel again.TaliaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",0
1155,1,"I downloaded this work because it was free.  I dislike it enough to want to warn everyone else away from it.  Why?  The premise of the story is ridiculous.  The story itself is very badly written, with grotesque language misuse, jarringly bad grammar, and a monumentally inane ending.  The whole short story reads like ""fan fiction"" written by a teenager who didn't bother to do more than run a spell-checker on it before publishing.  Even putting the story away for a few days and re-reading it afresh and may be asking a literate, intelligent friend to read and critique it would have helped Mr. Bailey to make it better.  If this is a work of a mature adult who's actually spent time crafting and perfecting it, then I suggest he find another outlet for his creativity -- something that does not involve writing or story telling.",0

There are names of people that you have no idea who they are, and there is a thing that I think was supposed to be a ghost, but you don't get clarification on that either. The second chapter starts with more people that you don't know, and goes into attempting to kill an unborn child. At that point I quit.

1170,1,"Welome to the negative review of the book everyone else loved.Let's begin shall we.I will start with the plot. When I was first reading the synopsis the plot sounded intriguing, and I loved the idea of the disgraced book hunter, and the lost Dickens story, but for some reason it ended up not working for me. I think that sex was introduced too early on, and was a distraction from what I liked about the idea of the book rather than something that added to the story.I liked James for the most part, and was able to sympathize with his plight. Losing the job he loved, and the security in his world must have been terrible, and, having worked retail, understand how frustrating, exhausting, and dehumanizing that can be. Added to the stress of trying to make ends meet on part time work without any sort of benefits, it's no wonder why he does what he does.Sedgwick, on the other hand, I never developed any affection for. I found him to be blunt to a point beyond simple rudeness, and his excuses seemed liked those of a child rather than a 42 year old man who should be old enough to understand proper behavior, or at least how to make a sincere apology for his words. I found his behavior, after he and James had a falling out, to be almost stalker like, and added to that he seems to almost bully James into hearing him out, and accepting his half hearted apology. He is also described as having a full beard, which is not my thing, and with all the scenes of both men eating had me truly grossed out imagining all the crumbs it must collect (this is not meant as a slight to any of my friends who have or enjoy beards, it's just not my thing.)For me the worst part of this book was the sex. This book had some of the hands down worst written sex scenes I've ever read, and let me tell you I have read some truly terrible sex scenes. Let's go to the book for some examples shall we.""Like a suede glove grabbing me, stroking me..Like a hot black fist.""What the hell is that supposed to mean, and why a black fist?""The pump and pull was like a hammer striking the golden frames of angel wings, pounding them into shining, glinting pennons. Perspiration sheened our bodies and our breath grew harsher as we bent our backs and worked the forge, and then the wings began to beat, trying to take flight, moving faster and faster, and we seemed to lift right off the ground, right off the pillows, and bedding, and hang there transfixed as warm, white Halle-fricking-lujah surged through.And then we dropped back to earth, wet, winded and weak. Human again.""Seriously what in the name of pink plastic ponies did I just read? I had to look up what a pennon was because I had no idea. Merriam-Webster was kind enough to tell me it ""a long usually triangular or swallow-tailed streamer typically attached to the head of a lance as an ensign"" which only made the sentence even more of a mystery to me because it sounded like the author was alluding to something that would be forged, like something made out of metal, say a sword, but the word he used meant something made of cloth. Color me confused. It's also some of the sappiest, most awkwardly written sex I've even read, and that's including the het 80's romance I read in high school. Nothing about this works for me on any level, and that's not the only angel reference during sex there is.""It was like landing on a cloud - with an angel on top of me. An angel that tasted like cinnamon and chocolate and stardust.""Really, exactly how old are these characters supposed to be because it sounds more like some child's fantasy of sex rather than real, adult sex. Sedgwick has some sort of whipped chocolate cr&egrave;me brulee body cream souffl&eacute; that only adds to my impression of them as much younger than they really are.My least favorite of the sex scenes has to be the one I included in my updates, but it bears repeating.""and it was sadly like a hood over the head of an angel, but better safe than sorry.The angel continued to blindly feel its way to the hot, candy-slick center hovering tentatively above it.There is nothing about that I find sexy, and ""candy-slick"" I guess I don't find candy to be very slick. I think of candy more as sticky which makes this analogy all that less appealing to me.In summary I will say I found the sappy, miracle ending to be the final straw. If things had been toned down quite a bit, and the characters' relationship allowed to develop at a more natural pace I might have enjoyed this book. Had the mystery of the Dickens story played a more significant role, and the sex scenes cut back I would have happily given this at least three stars. Alas this was not to be.",0

1175,2,"Review by Jen: When I accepted this book for review, I knew it was a novella.  In fact, I was looking for a short story.  But I didn't expect the book to be only 20 pages.  And therein lies the problem with this book.  It is very bare bones.  The book felt more like a plot outline of a longer story than the full book.  In fact, the story wasn't bad... there was a lot of promise.  As I came to the last page, I found myself wishing that we'd learned more about the characters, spent more time with them, saw more action.I looked up Dawn's website when I saw this was the first book in a series.  I wanted to see if the next book followed Alex and Sylvia, because then maybe it wouldn't be so bad that this tale was so short.  But, the other two books are about new couples... all of them revolving around lighthouse keepers.  And they are all about 7,000 words long.  I think it would be best to either expand on these stories or package them as an anthology as it's not worth $1.99 each.",0
1176,1,This book has way too much explicit sex. Leave something to the imagination - it would make it MUCH more interesting. Could not finish it. I do not recommend it.,0
1177,2,I didn't enjoy this book as much as I thought I would. It felt like the writer was confused as to what she wanted the book to be about or at least that is what I got from it.,0
1178,2,"I read both of the existing reviews before purchasing this book, and also read a bit of the sample.  The sample sold me, and I decided to plunk down the money and take a chance.  I probably should have listened to the 3-star reviewer...  In the end, the story really was not even a three-star, hence my rating, as well.First off, yes, I was fascinated by Cavan's background.  His pain was my pain.  But I felt as though the character of the dom, Biton, fell flat, and the story felt rushed, especially the ending.  More importantly, I felt as though the short-shrift given to Cavan's recovery (which I'll go into a bit more detail about below) did a disservice to the plight of abused and neglected children in general.  Sorry about the high-horse here, but my livelihood is inextricably intertwined with child abuse/neglect and the law, so I'm probably overly sensitive to the issue.MILD SPOILERS FOLLOW:Biton is a high-powered attorney who is gay and into the BDSM lifestyle.  He has just lost his longtime love and sub of 10 years, Erik, and is in mourning.  He's lonely enough that he enters into a short, 30-day ""contract"" with Cavan, an abused (tortured, literally) young man who is lost/floundering when he is rescued from his former ""master.""  Biton feels for Cavan, and is also very attracted to him.  But when he realizes what Cavan has been through, he takes Cavan's recovery on as a single-minded mission.Great setup, definitely.  But a story like this, that revolves around serious issues of child physical and sexual abuse needs more care, in my opinion.  The depth of writing was simply lacking.  Maybe it's just that the subject matter was better suited to something other than erotica (where sex between the characters is de riguer).True, Biton wants to do the right thing by Cavan, which is admirable.  But Cavan's therapist tells Biton not to have sexual relations with the young man until he is ""healed.""  And yet, after 3 weeks of therapy (yes, three weeks!), they are doing the deed again.  And not just having sex, either, but with restraints and whips!  No therapist okay or anything.  I have a little experience with the ramifications of child abuse and neglect in both my personal and professional lives.  There is no way that 3 weeks is enough to ""recover"" from what this man went through as a child.  That part made me cringe.  I wanted to shoot Biton, not hug him for going to bat for Cavan!Beyond that criticism, the entire recovery (3 weeks worth) was just sort of glossed over.  Then we have one sex scene and -boom - the book is over.  From what I read in another review, there is apparently a sequel.  I don't think I'll be buying it, much as I'd love to know what happens in the long run.I am sure Ms. Kersten really believed she was doing right by her characters and even for the cause of child abuse, but I think she really bit off more than she could chew with this depth of abuse.  A part of me just couldn't imagine poor Cavan could EVER consent to BDSM after what he had been through, and the fact that Biton believed he could left me with a bitter taste in my mouth.  Maybe in the sequel, the author addresses these difficult issues.",0
1179,2,"REVISED 05-06-13: My initial inclination was to rate this set 4 or 5 stars until I realized it TOTALLY and consistently ignored Austen's use of italics in all her major works. Where Austen italicized a word for emphasis, this Bedford edition doesn't do so. Nor does it use all caps to equal italics, nor even before-and-after underlines (_like this_) the way some other editions do. When this was priced at only a dollar, some readers might have been willing to overlook this defect (if they were even aware of it), but now that the price has doubled to $1.99 (the same price as 2 superior editions in the Kindle Store), one shouldn't have to. I consider this a serious enough flaw to rate this Bedford edition only 2 stars (and as a fan of Jane Austen, I was sorely tempted to even rate it one lower).Some readers of this review may wonder why I consider this worthy of criticism. I do because Austen (whose wonderful works rate 5+ stars) was a true wordsmith; she meant precisely what she wrote and the manner in which she wrote it. The words she chose to emphasize contribute to the way she intended her stories to be read and understood. Since she is not excessive in her use of italics, when she does so it is significant to the precise nuance or witticism she is trying to put across. That's why it IS a big deal. Without italics, something of Austen is lost. Reputable print editions all have them; why not all ebook versions? Why not THIS one?Except for this defect the Bedford Park edition provides easy access to each title and to the chapters within each title. It provides the finished and unfinished novels plus a sampling of juvenilia. And the formatting is fine--except for the aforementioned lack of any indication of emphasis throughout (a defect which seriously mars an otherwise fine set).One can get virtually EVERYTHING Austen wrote for the same price ($1.99) from Delphi and from Palmera. (To see for yourself, type ""Delphi Austen"" or ""Palmera Austen"" in the Kindle Bookstore searchbox.) Delphi uses italics in 4 of the 6 major works; Palmera in 5 (so I lean toward Palmera). I did NOT recommend this Bedford edition when it was priced at only a dollar, and I do not recommend it now at twice that.",0
1180,2,"I bought this thinking it was another book, but it is more like a description of a scene.  It describes the main character's reception at his girlfriend's family's gathering and that's about it.

1183,1,"**Possible Spoilers** If I had to review this book in one word it would be 'ridiculous'.  I had high hopes the first few pages as the initial crime unfolded.  I went into it willing to suspend belief about a model using that profession as a cover for her real job as a CIA agent.  When I read Jaclyn's back story about her parents and her near blindness I thought, ""Hmmm...this is intriguing.""Before too long though it became apparent that this book was going to fail due to cartoonish bag guys, silly superhero type gadgetry, and a plot whose holes you could fly a plane through.What could have been an interesting thriller was anything but.  The villain of the piece was presented immediately.  A mystery surrounding who murdered the 46 people with poisoned bottled water would have been engrossing.  Instead, super baddie, (and comically sociopathic) Grant Chillings is dumped into the reader's lap.I kept waiting for a clever explanation for his horrible deeds and how, exactly, he planned to gain the monopoly on the bottled beverage industry but it never materialized.  His end game was that he was going to add poison to his competitor's products and the local water supply, thereby forcing people to drink his bottled water or nothing at all.  He wasn't going to get caught or prosecuted for his crimes because he was justified in commiting them and the government wouldn't dare touch him.  I'm no expert, but I believe that narcissists feel justified in their actions, but they aren't patently stupid.When he murdered the entire Board of Directors of his company I was thinking, ""You don't think somebody might notice you did that?""Then we come to our heroine.  Again, this could have been a very interesting character, but failed miserably.  We are asked to believe that the government could only spare one inexperienced CIA agent and a 'watchdog' for her after 46 people die from poisoning and later 9 children are hospitalized in another attempt.  That's how the government would react to terrorism?When Agent 'Snapshot's' partner is eventually killed she is told by the director of the CIA that she'll have to 'go it alone' since they can't spare anybody else to help out with the investigation.  Riiiigggghhhht.The rest of this tale consists of Jaclyn running around in a skin tight black jumpsuit that is equipped with special spy toys, using her custom made spy Porche to wage war on Grant Chilling's laughable 'army' (in one of Boston's main government buildings, no less), and the female President of the United States using Boston's Duck Boats to storm the villain's lair.  If it sounds stupid that's because it is...painfully so.Also, the author's insistence on describing Jaclyn's profuse sweating as she runs around Boston in her spy suit and trenchcoat became sickening.One surprise bright side to this book was the unintentional comedic factor.  I found myself chuckling at several of the more absurd parts such as Jaclyn's mercurial response to different situations, which I can't imagine any self respecting CIA agent indulging in.  Also, the idea of government sanctioned destruction of city property (including missiles launched from Jaclyn's car) had me laughing and shaking my head.Most amusing were the spy toys Jaclyn had at her disposal.  The unfortunate part is that none of them really helped her.  With the exception of her body armor and the security system evading app for her iPad, the bad guys still kept getting the jump on her.For a woman who was trained to use all her senses in deference of her very poor eyesight and who was required to take out several Navy SEALS as a part of that training; she was amazingly inept at defending herself.I considered giving this book 2 stars because it had potential, but decided that it merited only one because of its blatant waste of a good story line.",0

1187,2,"I really, really wanted to like this book, but I think my favorite part was when I hit 90% finished and I realized I was almost done. That usually isn't a good sign, is it?This is a ebook-exclusive novel by Lilith Saintcrow (whose previous novels I have not and probably never will read) about a young woman named Vianne who is a practicing hedgewitch and close courtesan to the princess Lisele. Hedgewitchery, a vague and oft-used type of peasant sorcery, was what I was so excited about reading this book, because I love books that build new types of magic and I like seeing how that magic works with the characters. But unfortunately, hedgewitchery wasn't really explained enough. Can everyone do it? Why are some better at it than others? What is its intended or common use? And how does it differ from the fancier court sorcery? All questions I had that were never really answered, which ticked me off. I can't envelope myself in the story if I have so many basic, unanswered questions.One day, Vianne has a run-in with Tristan d'Arcenne, one of the king's Guard and his trusted Left Hand. He kills a man in the palace, shocking Vianne, who goes to the king, but the king just tells her everything is fine. Vianne flees, but later, she discovers her dear princess, all of the court ladies, and even the king had been violently murdered. As her last dying wish, Lisele gives Vianne the Aryx, a magical royal medallion that basically makes Vianne queen, since it awakens to her ownership. Vianne saves Tristan from the dungeon and they meet up with the rest of the guard and flee for Arcenne, where Vianne can be safe. Along the way, Vianne discovers that she is the only living royal blood left, since the rest of the king's distant relations were being systematically killed by d'Orlaans, who wants the kingdom. She can either marry the evil man who killed her loved ones, or rule as queen in Arcenne and take Tristan as her trusted Consort.It is a great fantasy plot- young woman must use her untapped talents to make a great journey while falling in love. Unfortunately, Vianne spends most of her time whining, swooning, and falling ill with fever. She was so unpleasant to read as a heroine because she really WASN'T a heroine at all, only a spoiled, weak little girl who keeps trying to throw the amazing power she's been given off on someone else. I want to read about strong and capable women getting shit done, not girls who only wish to wear dresses and fiddle with herbs and books (both are fine, but do it with a little passion!). The entire first 3/4 of the novel are devoted to the Guard having to stay behind in small cities while Vianne sleeps and rests from a fever. And then she plots ways to get rid of the Aryx and give up. I just don't identify with characters like Vianne, and even after she accepts her role as queen and takes charge, she still has that resisting, whiny way about her.One major thing that turned me off from this novel was the language. The dialect is some weird, bastardized pseudo-French with words like ""m'dmselle"" instead of mademoiselle, ""Palais"" insead of palace, and ""m'chri"" instead of ""mon cherie"". The names are also WAY too complicated and wordy, which would be alright if we had more backstory on the families, but since we don't, they just confuse the reader. It took me halfway through the novel to know the differences between the guard members. The language may be pretty, but it didn't add anything to an already muddled novel.I wanted to get into this book. The plot was enticing, the romance between Vianne and Tristan had its moments of sweetness and sexiness, and I enjoyed the parts when Vianne bonded with the R'Mini people, but too many annoying things just got in the way of my enjoyment. I don't think I'll read the sequel.",0

Here you get yourself up to date on how many children everyone has, how happy they all are and how wholesome their lives are.  It's like a Hallmark card and many fans will like it.But for me, this should not have cost even 99 cents.  This is all stuff that, as one reviewer here said, should have been supplied for free on Balogh's website.  Maybe she's needing to accumulate money for her old age.

1197,2,"The big CHALLENGE in this story was trying to keep up with it. There were so may missing pieces to this puzzle it made reading it...well, puzzling.First, the premise of the story was a bit shaky.  Niki, a paranoid, woman-of-steel who has a few meltdowns which leave her babbling incoherently to herself, drugs herself to sleep and mistakenly has the best sex of her life with Tony, who is so wasted, he also thinks the sex is a figment of his overactive imagination.The next morning brings the horrible realization that the encounter was not a dream. Niki wants to obliterate the entire event from her life and apparently has been trained by her grandmother to do just that. She hires the people to make the event disappear from all records. Then she finds out she is pregnant. This is where the story entered it's decent into the abyss.Niki could, on some levels, be hard to like. She seemed too hard for no reason. When she found out she was pregnant, she didn't even do all she could to find Tony, in fact, when they meet later, she is unwilling to confirm that she is even pregnant by him until her attorney tells her it could be trouble. That's low down to me, but, moving back to the topic, the story goes from her finding out she is pregnant to her speaking of the ""babies"" she is carrying WITHOUT mentioning she is having twins. I thought I had skipped a passage because that kind of news would be a big deal to someone who is knocked up by accident, so I back tracked, but there was no revelation or disclosure of her being pregnant with twins until much later on, up to that point I had to read the story wondering if it had been a typo(which is not uncommon in this genera) or if she really was having more than one baby.There also was another guy interested in her; David, he had been after here for a few years but she always sensed something was not right with him. I thought this would eventually be revealed but nothing really materialized except he was sleeping with another woman, whom she was friends with, while pursuing her. Which is in poor taste but hell, she wasn't giving him any play so you can't be mad if he chooses to go where the fish are biting.A few other things stuck out in this story. There was the unusual animosity her grandmothers had towards Tony for mistakenly sleeping with Niki. It pissed me off because he was just as much a victim as Niki was and unlike Niki, tried to give her a way to contact him if there was a pregnancy. His approach was logical while hers seemed borderline schizophrenic. They all focused on the fact that he was drunk that night but the story took a very jagged path in getting us to the point where we found out why that mattered. By then, the story was on the skids so it seemed like much ado about nothing!The way Niki accepted Tony and fell in love with him was totally out of character for her up to that point. It was like reading another story. In fact, this seemed like a story the author had sitting around and decided to finish it, but forgot to go back to make sure everything blended or was cohesive with the new rewrites and edits. This was a huge miss for this writer who hooked me with her Men of 3X CONstruction series. Skip this one!",0

Then the plot weakens....One of the book's biggest mysteries must be that, whilst huge numbers of indiginent Pacific islanders evolve by scratching out a living fishing off a sand-bar of an island, this extemely large, visible (it has a huge mountain in the middle) island, remains undiscovered. A pity because this surely must be one of the most verdant, farming-friendly, mineral wealthy islands on Earth. It is also extremely well-stocked with all manner of useful, & tasty beasts. Our heroes, in a few short years, manage to become completely self-sufficient & are soon spoilt for choice as to where to abide & what to have for supper.I would estimate that a full eighty percent of the plot is dedicated to the ingenious, almost miraculous, development of the island's bounty. Our five heroes are the most innovative of castaways; nothing is beyond them. During their time on the island they have the know-how & resources to produce bricks, pottery, ironware, gunpowder, nitro-glycerene, etc. etc., even introducing a telegraph system & no detail is spared in the descriptions of each operation. As a consequence the book reads like a cross between Handyman's Journal, Construction Weekly & Farming Monthly.The castaways are a deadly boring bunch. They quickly become firm friends; respectful, tolerant & pass their time in mutual hero-worship & devotion. They are such a 'hail-fellow & well met' group that there is a complete absence of any sort of jealousy, resentment, discontent or moaning; indeed a complete absence of any emotional excitement.There is a mystery involved but I didn't feel it worth the effort of wading through the massive amount of technical details to find out the end result.Look here for blandness & do-it-yourself tips; look elsewhere for adventure.",0

I thought about giving this a one star, but I have enjoyed Lora's other books and since I have, just couldn't find myself doing that. Very disappointed in it.",0

1208,2,"Alright, it is what it is... Erotica, but boring. It's not a very long read but it's not incredibly short either.What turned me off, (no pun intended) was it was just straight sex from the 1st chapter til like chapter 8. Now I love my smuttiness just as much as the next horn toad, but I like to be stimulated on all fronts in order for me to enjoy the book.The sex, because it's erotica, was still plentiful throughout the novel but it wasn't until after chapter 9 that a story started to form. I really wish the story started to break more ground in the beginning & middle so that the ""passion"" would have been hotter. I didn't believe this connection between the Alpha & heroine or even the urgency of the Breeding Cycle that the heroine had to endure. So therefore none of my juices were flowing. Or it could just be that my sex life is much hotter than theirs' in this book.And even when the plot began to unfold, it was just all simple filler that had me rolling my eyes. The dialogue was just as campy IMO, too. It felt like maybe someone in JR. High or a Freshmen in high school wrote this book, concerning the dialogue. This author succeeded in one thing with this story, putting Alphas & their Packs to shame.So yeah, while there is plenty of sex, it still doesn't live up to the ""hotness"" that it promises. A decent plot that could have been great if it was executed better.But if all you want is an erotic read with no substance, I'd say give this one a go.",0

This book has many pit falls.* From my point of view, the concept of the story is very interesting to read and would be a great book to read if someone else would tell this story.* The story telling is not the best. The main character keeps reminiscing about what has taken place yesterday, instead of getting on with the present situation what he is facing. I have find this very off putting and annoying.",0
1216,2,"***May contain SPOILERS*** (but it would be hard to tell as confusing as this book was...)This started out okay, for the first few pages.  Belinda's sister Kate has gone missing so she sort of dives into Kate's polar opposite type life to see if she can discover who or what made Kate run off.  Except maybe Kate didn't run off because she is known to be flighty and travels a lot.  But that's okay, Belinda decides to take on Kate's life in an attempt to sort it all out, despite the fact she has only been gone a few days and this is not out of character.I get that they are opposites.  Kate is flighty and ""hip"" and into the alternative music/DJ scene and is totally attractive to men.  While Belinda is, umm, well, Belinda looks just exactly like Kate except, umm, she is unattractive and fat--except without doing much more than wearing Kate's clothes she is a dead ringer for her.  And, umm, she is the smart one, yeah, that's it.  With an eidetic memory.  Even though, umm, there really is no such thing, but whatever, she needs some way to be able to pull minute details from conversations she had with her sister out of nowhere to convince others that she really is Kate.  That was just too weird.  Belinda comes across as totally flighty herself, daydreaming away during her ""dates"" with the men Kate met online and then all of a sudden she is like, ""oh, yeah, on February 19th, 2002 which was a snowy day with temps in the low 20s Kate was telling me....""  As a plot device it was useless and unbelievable.The pages and pages of DJ junk and head banging, clap your hands, I will ROCK you scenes were overlong and boring to read.  And then there was the ending.  Wow.  And not Wow in a good way.  I got it.  It was all sliding doors and turnarounds.  But so much set up and BS for that?  It was more of a let down than a bizarre twist.  I didn't find Belinda likable in any form she took.  The twists were unreal and more than a bit whacked.  The last several pages added nothing but a deeper sense of dislike for Belinda.  The only character I came close to liking was teh Kiwi, and he had to be more than a bit off to put up with all he did.  The basic concept was good.  I just wish the author had gone in a different direction with it.",0
1217,2,"I read the reviews before getting the book and even though the majority of them warned about the 'had' issue, I still got the book.

That sets off a chain of events that makes Diona end up in the arms of a very wealthy and powerful Greek Nikias, who has his own plans.PROS: The premise is good and the story has the potential of being very erotic and very sexy.CONS: I applaud the author for publishing a book, however, the author really needs to invest in a proofreader and editor. This book is probably a good example of why so many people do not take self-publishing authors seriously. As much as I would love to give this book a 1-star rating, I simply can't do it.Again, the potential is there for this to be a great book but lots and lots of editing need to be done first.",0

I tried...made it through 50% of the book and that felt like a major accomplishment. It shouldn't be this hard. I almost bought the boxed set last week. I am certainly glad I stifled that urge...",0

Too any loose ends.. .",0
1224,2,The quick description on my Kindle made this book sound good to me.  As I started reading it I got bored by a third of the way through.  Every paragraph seemed to be saying the same thing. It's as if the author was obligated to write a book with a certain amount of words and thats all it was....boring words. The story moved too slow.  I would not recommend this book. There are others in the same genre that are much better.,0

1226,2,"I like the world this takes place in and I like most of the characters, but the main character is a limp dishrag.  I am a little over halfway through and am already tired of her constant whining and her poor self-image.  Lilith Saintcrow is known for her kick-ass heroines, but she missed the mark in this book.  I am finishing this book in the hopes that the heroine finally comes out of her self-pitying fog and steps up to the plate.  I really dislike characters who constantly misinterpret the obvious and are constantly wailing - why me, why me?  I hope it improves.  I think it could be a good book.  I am hoping!  I really want to like this book.  I must say, I finished the book and unfortunately it didn't get any better, in fact; it got worse.  Sorry, I will not be reading any further in the series.  Now, not only is the heroine a ninny, but the hero is more of a villian and a creepy stalker.  Oh well, it was only $2.99, not a drain on my finances like some of the kindle books.",0
1227,2,"At age fifty; Samantha Sweet&#8217;s dream was to own a bakery featuring cakes, cookies, and cupcakes.  Currently, she was doing her baking at home under less than ideal conditions.  Until she saved enough money to accomplish that she worked part time for a government agency cleaning and maintaining homes that had gone into default.  Her job was to get them into shape to be sold.One day, she found a very ill, very unusual woman lying in bed in one of the houses.  The woman gave Sam a box which she said had special powers, then she died.  When she was mowing the yard at the next house, she discovered an unidentified grave.  Both those finds play major roles in SWEET MASTERPIECE.Her new powers give her more energy and the ability to see things others cannot.  The body in the grave is that of a recluse, an elderly man who turned out to have been a famous painter.  The sheriff&#8217;s department initially believes he may have died from pneumonia or another natural cause.While the book was a fast read and well-written, I found the plot to be very thin.  There were some very good descriptions of various locations.  It had a lot of filler material about making cakes and cupcakes (no recipes were provided) and an overview, repeated several times, of what Sam did to prepare a house.The book has a lot of characters, primarily some of Sam&#8217;s long-time friends.  She talks about her daughter Kelly who cleaned out Sam&#8217;s savings.  Later the daughter returns but the story doesn&#8217;t give enough details about why she quit her job or why she suddenly changed.Another main character is the sheriff, Beau Cardwell.  The relationship between him and Sam moves too quickly without explanation of Beau&#8217;s motivation.Overall, I found the book to be boring because of all the surface attention given to Sam&#8217;s jobs. It might have made a better short story.This book was a free Amazon download.",0
1228,2,"I was fairly surprised at the level of raunchiness in this one. Maybe I should have read the reviews, because the synopsis is misleading. This book goes beyond kinky.

First, I didn't count them, but I'd be real surprised if there were even 200 jokes in this book. Second, among those 200 possible jokes, at least 50 were repeated 2 or more time in different parts of the book. It's almost as if the writer kept a running list of jokes as he heard them, with no real concern about whether or not they might already have been recorded. Then he decided there MUST be at least 500 jokes here. Finally, to be perfectly frank with you, I do not recall laughing at a single one of these ""jokes"". Most were better described as insults, mistaking the degradation of a group of people for humor. Very ""7th Grade"" material. Don't bother with this one. It's not worth the 99 cents. It's not even worth ""free"".",0

1231,2,"The idea of an intelligent woman opening her own private investigation firm and having adventures is the stuff of a good book.  This one isn't necessarily it.  The central character, Dix, needs further development to create someone that reader can care about.  The police detective is too buffonish to seem real.  Mrs. Priestly is, of course, adorable and one of the very best parts of the storyline.  It would be fun to develop her into a central character for a book and explore her quirky side.",0

The Viola in this story is more of a ""typical teenager"" than she is in the books -- all she did was whine, mope about, not appreciate what her parents and others did for her, and whine. Did I mention whine? Because she sure did whine.Maybe younger folks are interested in reading about characters like that, but older ones might want to skip this (even though it's free).It is a YA book/story, so I'm not blaming Ness for making her a realistic teenager, I'm just saying that as an adult, it was no fun at all to read.",0

1240,1,"From the cover I thought I would really like this book. The only thing I liked about it was the cover. There is no mystery or suspense in the book at all. It is very predictable. You know who the killer is almost from the very beginning. Even though the author attempts to throw off who the real killer is, it is a poor and lame attempt. The main character Tyler seems to gain super human strength and intelligence at times. If it wasn't for his ""intuition"" and sudden knowledge of things he had no previous knowledge of a few chapters previously, then there would be no way for him to ""solve"" the murders. The portrayal of the police is laughable at times. They're idiotic morons when the author needs them to be and super sleuths when he needs the story to move forward. All of the characters need more development and are poorly written. I'm not sure what all the 5 star reviews were for. I'm glad I got this as a free download I would not have been pleased if I had paid for this.I normally try to find something I like in a book, but in this one I can't say there is anything.",0
1241,2,"Scribner, in these three short stories, spends too much energy thinking up unusual situations and not enough time helping his readers understand the situation or how his characters respond to them.  One of the stories is just a scientist describing the (unlikely) results of an experiment, leaving me to wonder what the author was going for.  Am I supposed to be impressed that he could think of an unusual situation and then reveal it via exposition?  What is the intended response to these stories?",0

He thinks she's super sexy and he wants to be the perfect rough, yet tender, lover for her.  Will his new job separate them?  The suspense isn't all that suspenseful and the sex scenes aren't very hot at all.  I'd skip this one.",0
1244,1,"I couldn't make it past chapter 2.  I dislike giving 1 star reviews and I am the first to admit that I may be more picky that most, and I don't want to take away from the author's hard work by tearing her book apart, but I do feel I should explain why I stopped reading after chapter 2.Through most of the first chapter it was hard to tell if the writer was writing in first person or third person.  I love fantasy, paranormal, and science fiction...a lot! But, chains that pop out of your body to tell who your life mate is, well, seems beyond weird and a little gross.  But the clencher was the sex scene in chapter 2.  It was rape.  She said no, period.  I have a hard time with ""erotica"" that passes off rape as sensual and enjoyable.So, there you have it.  Maybe it gets better after chapter 2, I don't know.",0
1245,2,"Despite the stereotype characters, the book is entertaining. The main character has a nice personality, maybe too nice. My only complain is that the story is based on the premise that only skinny girls can be 'hot'.",0
1246,1,"The story was all over the place, I agree with the first reviewer, it was written in such a juvenile sense you'd think a kid just trying their hand at writing wrote this story.  It was all over the place, constant name dropping, events taking place that didn't make sense.  I'm going to attribute the author being incarcerated as a reason that certain things weren't researched, then again, the male character dropped african knowledge on the lead character so some research had to be done, but not enough to bring the story together.  There was no character or story development, I didn't understand half the drama because it came out of left field and it wasn't developed enough to make you feel any kind of way.  The premise of the story is actually pretty good and so much could have been done with it but the book needed to be completely rewritten with the premise in mind to make it a good story.  It could have been one, but this author just didn't get it done.  This book was so bad I couldn't help but continue to read it just to see how much worse it could really get.  And it outdid itself.  I would say the author needs to read different styles of writing to come into his own, learn story and character development, like I said great premise but it could have been written a whole lot better.  Winny Williams? 'Back in the days'? A month past her due date to have a 8lb baby? Going to rehab for marijuana? It's a BUNCH of other things that will make you say, huh? And scratch your head.  The author possibly has a future, but much more practice is needed, you'd be okay with this book if the author was lets say between the ages of 12-17 and just started writting just because, handed in the manuscript with little editing and turned it into book form.  It would make sense then, but this is not a good book, it had potential but the writing is NOT up to par at all.",0

1248,2,"Note the title.  This is a selection of fairy tales, in fairly poor translation, not the full ""Grimm's Fairy TALES"", or ""Household Stories"" collection.  There are places where the stories seem to drop off or change direction suddenly mid-stream.  ""The Little Brother and Little Sister"", for example, is missing a paragraph that is in other versions, which is needed to follow the plot.A few stories seem to have no point or plot at all, or added endings, although ""Catherine and Frederick"" is only a little worse here than in other versions I have found.  Most of the good stories are repeated in better collections.Only notable bits:""Bearskin"" is one that isn't in every collection of Grimm's Tales, and I found it enjoyable.  I prefer the stories like this and ""The Six Swans"", in which the day is won through persistence and cleverness. Also, he cheats the devil, which is always a nice touch. Many of these stories are solved through nothing more interesting than dumb luck.This version of ""The Frog Prince"" has a very beautiful beginning, but the rest of the story is disjointed, uninspired, and annoying.Overall it was very uneven, and next time I'll search Project Gutenberg for the full tales.",0
1249,2,"As the other reviewers stated this was a very SHORT story.  At this length there is no way it could be worth the price even if written by the worlds greatest author.

1252,2,"Lucidity: A Ghost of a Love Story is a paranormal romance novel in the Gothic tradition. Grace Moran is a widow and an agoraphobic. She's in the hospital about to undergo surgery. She's terrified because she fears she will lose her spiritual connection with her dead husband if she has the surgery. He was murdered and Lukas, his killer, is undergoing treatment for his mental condition in the same hospital to which Grace was admitted. The narrative is rounded out by two other patients also undergoing intense medical treatment. Lukas and Grace are intertwined in both the past and present through Jimmy's murder and his returning spirit.In order to flesh out this connection between murderer and survivor, Lyons shifts time in the narrative. We jump from past to present and back as Lyons draws a more complete picture of the history that led us to this point. Unfortunately, the myriad of details thrust upon us do not always make direct connections to the present. The details often felt superfluous and pointless. Just as we were digging our way out of Jack the Ripper, we're thrust into a debate on the right to die issue. And then there's that sex with a ghost thing... the narrative began to feel like a maze with each turn taking a more bizarre angle.This was my first novel from CJ Lyons. I've read a lot of praise for her work, but this one failed to impress me. Bizarre, disjointed, and far from paranormal, I was never sure what Lyons wanted me to be reading. What was the point here? Was this a medical thriller? A paranormal romance? A ghost story? The novel just never came together entirely.",0

Otherwise, the story started out pretty well but soon became somewhat difficult to follow; as the story progressed, it became more and more implausible. The ending was so abrupt as to be very surprising.  It just stopped leaving the reader to wonder if the publisher had omitted a couple of chapters. Character development of the principals was barely satisfactory, and the others were just cardboard characters at best. As the story moved to its climax, it seemed that the author wanted to get it over with, and some really important developments to the story were dealt with summarily and without any real substance.  This of course led to greater implausibility. There were some misspelled words and the like along the way, so better editing and proofing would help in his next effort for which I wish him good luck.",0

Mollie joins a fitness club because she is overweight and out of shape presumably so she will be worthy of the dreamy JC.  We know that Mollie is miserable and suffers from low self-esteem because she whines about it incessantly to anyone who will listen and, man, did I ever feel sorry for them.  And now we meet the hero Conner, Suzy's cousin, gym owner and fitness instructor, owner of a muscle-bound hardbody, who falls into instant lust with ""curvy"" out-of shape Mollie. Mollie falls hard for Conner's manly form, but knows that her ""curves"" and the fact that she sweats will turn him off because he is surrounded by evil, predatory, size 2 bimbos who sport fake, pointy nails.

But it strains credulity to think that a man who has dedicated his life to fitness would lust after a woman who is carrying around enough extra weight to have rolls of flesh and shortness of breath. He doesn't want her to lose weight even though her health is adversely affected and she WANTS to shape up. When Conner's reason for wanting Mollie to stay chunky is revealed, my eyes just about rolled out of my head. Bad agenda, Conner. You need therapy.About those sex scenes. I did not enjoy reading them and I am a fan of well-written erotica. The author must have gone to The Big Golden Book of Euphemisms for Ladyparts.  The overuse of the term ""weeping flesh"" made me worry that poor Mollie needs to see her gyno, stat.The dialogue between the girlfriends...what can I say...unnatural and jarring. Exposition is clumsy, phrasing is awkward, information is delivered via dump truck. The writing is so painfully amateurish that I had to force myself to finish it.  The best thing I can say for this novella is that it's mercifully short.",0
1263,1,This book could only be a joke.  Which man is going to allow other men to grope and fondle the woman he is about to marry.  The way this goes she should have screamed or called the police from the beginning of the book.  She was in a room of perverts and she even became one.  This book was sick.,0
1264,2,"The book started well enough, but soon got bogged down in itself.  The transition of the character was clumsy, there were multiple grammatical problems including switching from first to third person in the same paragraph.  The whole thing seemed rushed and as if were written by someone very young.  The premise for the story was fine, but it was not very well-developed.  Note to author: The name is HAN Solo, NOT HANS Solo!",0
1265,2,"Fenton is a vampire, a very lonely vampire.  In this short story ( 25 pages or so ) we are introduced to him, and sadly it then gets quite muddled with little character development.  The characters are flat and rather vague, the writer seems to have lost the urge to develop them more fully, although does provide a nice insight into the thought process of Fenton.  I wish that were developed better, so that I would have a reason to look to the series from which this is drawn.Editing was an issue, typos were scattered throughout, and there was a great lack of continuity or explanation of the missing years as this short story jumped about quite a bit.What was refreshing, and may be a draw for others, is the near asexual characterization of Fenton, and the reasonable twist into the ""thought process"" of a vampire - which up to this point is not one that we have seen to be so close to human with it's insecurities and self doubts.I don't, however, think I will judge the series based on a short story. Short story crafting is a specific talent, and many long-form authors are not necessarily adept.  I would pass on this story, and be willing to read one of the full length books provided an editor and proofreader were involved.",0
1266,2,"The story idea was great and I looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to expectations. The writing was okay but it was flat. The story was outlandish. Who can leave a home, job and dog for a few days, rent a car for that time period and then nonchalantly decide to stay for a month with no personal repercussions? Who can think he's being kept as a hostage and can have his property taken from him because his sister is a spoiled brat?The characters were flat and at no time did I feel involved in this book. It was an exercise in my patience to finish it. This is the type of review I hate to write because I know the author worked hard but I just can't find much good about this book.",0
1267,1,"The only reason I'd recommend this story to anyone is because it's free and so short you really don't have to commit that much time to it.There was nothing original here, which isn't always a bad thing if the story is well done. I found this one very rushed. I never connected with Sara (killing vampires to avenge her brother and friend's murders) or Wyatt (the sexy vampire originally sent to watch her after her brother died & now to stop her vampire killing).  It was unclear who Wyatt is or what his ""choice"" is - to stop or kill Sara? to date her or leave her?  The ""bad guy"" was also pretty random & unconnected to the overarching story.I've never read anything by this author, and if she has full length novels, I hope they are better edited than this. Spelling errors, typos & grammatical errors are a pet peeve, therefore, I rarely comment on them in a review unless it's really bad. There were so many mistakes littered in such a short story that it became distracting.",0
1268,2,I don't know why on earth this book would come up under horror. It contains a silly list of things to do and not do when you travel with a vampire. It is written in what I would guess to be from a young girl's point of view and the tone is grating. I hate to start a book and not finish it so I did. I did not enjoy this one at all. It is plain silly. I could see a young person liking it but that is about it. Maybe this form of writing just isn't my cup of tea but I found it irritating.,0
1269,1,"While the plot was very good, I had a hard time staying interested as the story was disjointed.  Human beings, even good faith filled ones, do not talk and act as portrayed in this story.

I did time in the service. I did time in wal-mart. I did time as a university professor. They were all pretty much the same.""Sometimes everyone around me appears to be crazy except me and thee, and sometimes I wonder about thee"".  I found it boring.  She did the best to do character development.  Some of them were pretty good.  Dr Goodspeed was good.  He was my office partner five years ago.  Capt. Roy was good he was really Col.

1273,2,"I love paranormal/shifter novels....this one not so much. Here was a pack of shifting werewolves with the right history and plot and then nothing happened. Aby and Keith were characters that could have gone somewhere but I was more interested in Gavin and Samantha's story. For this book to have been the first of the series, I would have expected more backstory for as many characters that were introduced here.Also, I waited for the shifting to begin.....Maybe in a moment where I wasn't looking, some shifting took place. During thr fight scenes (where you would have expected it, no one changed). Maybe I'll have to go back a re-read in order to appreciate the three and four stars that others gave this book.",0
1274,1,"I purchased this story because of the setting.  I usually love Scottish romances and am a fan of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series.  I figured this would be a short, enjoyable story...and in all truth, it should have been.  It has the makings of a wonderful story, but it seems as if the author got greedy and decided to publish a skeletal outline for a quick sale.  There are too many holes, and it's simply too short to be worth paying for.  For instance, once he realizes ""Reva"" is a girl, he decides to hold her hostage instead of having her executed.  He tells her she has earned her next meal and better lodging, and then in the next sentence, suddenly it's 2 months later and they can't stop thinking of each other.  What?!  She's coming to breakfast, he's staring at her, and they've both fallen in love with each other during those 2 months, even though from what I can tell, they never actually talk to each other?  He still doesn't know who she is, and all she knows of him comes from people who live under his protection.  This is a huge fault, Jackie Barbosa.  You cannot expect the reader to believe they are in love simply because you say they are.  We need to see some sort of progression.  And then to believe that she, a strong woman who would rather face execution and surrender her family name, would blurt out that she's fallen in love with him when  he's her familial enemy?  Ridiculous!  I'm insulted as a reader that I'm expected to just go along with this absurd plot with no attempt to show me how it happened.  With more length and attention to the missing pieces, this could have been a good story.  What a waste!",0
1275,2,I stopped reading this series after like the 3rd or 4th book because of how the book played out. It was really good at first I just couldn't stand the book:(,0
1276,1,"Sorry, but these are short, and I mean short stories, called a series, that are all about sex with just a brief smattering of a plot. Anybody can write about sex. But this author could not even come up with a decent plot? I noticed that all the books in this series are all very short. Why aren't these being sold at the price of novellas? I'm really disgusted with the lack of character development, scene development, and the shortage of all other descriptives that are usually included in a book. These are not books. These are little ditties, using sex as the marketing modality. Please, take down the price of this garbage to about 0.25 per short story and you might get some takers. But after they read the first one....I doubt you will have enough money to buy a loaf of bread. By the way....hire an editer.",0
1277,2,I felt like I was reading something by a 10th grader.  The dialog was often stilted and over the top.  It made the whole book less than enjoyable...it was just tedious.,0
1278,2,"Kind of cutesy spanking story.  This book is a bit dated since it is copyrighted in 2001 and the war mentioned looks like it was probably the Serb/Bosnian conflict.  Seems like ancient history today.  But a sexy, hot-bodied ex-military boy is always hot.  Descriptions of her &#34;custard&#34; bottom and character's use of &#34;sugar man&#34; when she's supposedly from San Francisco seem strange.  Also a scene where the hero is chasing the heroine with a belt and appears to be about ready to whack her in the face with it before they're interrupted, not even remotely sexy.  This is one of those just too cutely written stories for my taste.  Not awful but not really good and certainly nothing worth re-reading.",0
1279,2,Extreme fairytale. I'm a grow woman who grew out of fairytales decades ago. If you love syrupy books this is the one for you. The bdsm which only came in at the very end and only after they were married was sugary sweet and not at all what I consider bdsm.,0
1280,1,I don't see how a book can be published with sooo many errors.... SAD and not going to finish the book.  Does this only happen on KINDLE or in print also?  I can't believe a book could be published with no proof reading.,0
1281,1,"So this whole book takes place in one day. One day! Does Rae even get to sleep. I did not enjoy this book. Some simple basic spoilers I guess from this point but not detailed!Rae starts out as a girl learning to fight demons in a walled in enclosure where all humans live now. She goes out for a run learns she is a fairy, kisses a random boy runs, gets in trouble, goes back to the enclosure, finds a vampire, feels something for an ugly vampire after she just kissed said boy two seconds ago. Gets into a fight with a different boy, original boy comes to save her, more running and stuff get into another fight back at enclosure kills someone makes out with ugly vampire next to dead body, first boy the love of her life comes back. Yeah i mean that is pretty much the whole book, I mean there is more details some other little things but I mean come on.Space out the day, stop having Rae so wishy washy. Pick a thing. Maybe I'm just super sick of the love triangle thing but I mean I'm kind of over this. So much happened in one day!!!I don't know I'm just over it, it made me angry for some stupid reason.

1285,2,"This book is just so full of soap opera drama. The main Characters are so vain. They are supposed to be Christians but the author was so wrapped with their looks that she made no mention of their Christian community. Not every couple is a Osteen couple or a Bunchen/Brady couple. I personally found it condescending for the author to describe people with lesser look to be worse of than diseased.As I said, soap opera really. What does the author mean that on a close look Josh did not recognize Callan just because of a hair cut and make up. If you talk about changing hair color, dishing spectacles, hiding freckles and removing braces all at once, that could be reasonable but then, this is so soap opera.Did I mention the characters are so vain? Got me seething truly. Clay was so rude to Callan's Dad the first day he met him cause he did not want to meet with some daughter that he expected to look ugly. Not someone carrying some air borne disease of mouth odour. How is he a Christian. Clay and Callan were so self absorbed that they did not want to share themselves with children and if Clay was able to cross that (I quote) &#34;after seeing what lurked in the gene pool, it was a somewhat scary dive to contemplate&#34;! Can you believe that? Rejecting an unborn child because of the possibility of it's look! They did not even like being around ugly (to their definition) people.The author described the kids of Mel and Ted as sweet and tried to sell to us that Mel and Ted themselves where horrible UGLY people. Fact is, kids take the personality of their parents. A gloomy child has a gloomy parent, a smiley child has a smiley parent. The author describes the kids as VERY cheerful and tries to influence the reader to accept that the parents are hideous. Not working. You can't give what you don't have so Mel and Ted gets credit from me based on YOUR report on Audrey and Emma. The main characters are supposed to be Christians, YET when celebrating a marriage renewal vow in thanksgiving of life, they spite Callan brother Bob and her cousin Mel as well as their spouses. Even if you can sell that Bob, Donna, Mel and Ted are Hideous, as Christians are they not supposed to invite them? Is it not written that if we love only those that love us or let me use here, those that are as good as us, how then are we better off than the sinners for even they extend love one to another.This book is a book that can give you some low self esteem if you are not perfect. It is a book you can complete and make you discontent with yourself and life. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 to be objective, cos as a soap opera it passes more than 1 star. The Characters are so nipped and tucked!!!NO I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK AS A GOOD CHRISTIAN BOOK OR AS A GOOD SELF ESTEEM BOOK.",0
1286,2,So glad this was free....I would have been very upset to have paid for it. It had a few good lessons but my kids got bored with it way to easily.,0
1287,1,There was nothing hot about this story. I knew it was short but it should't evenn qualify as a short story. The characters are so underdeveloped and even the sex scenes...well sex snipplets I should say were totally not worth the five minutes I spent reading this story. It was a freebie and not worth the time i spent.,0
1288,1,Really did not find anything interesting in this.  Thought it would be fun and useful.  Not happening.  Most (if not all) ideas can be found searching the internet.  Vague instructions and to many spelling errors.  Would NOT recommend this book.  Honestly don't think it ever saw an editor. Author needs to learn the difference in piece and peace.,0

Is she a journalist or a gossip columnist?I've learned reading romances that I am going to have to accept that apparently people fall in love in 45 minutes or less and then decide to spend their lives together based on less than a teaspoon's worth of knowledge about the other person.

I suppose if you are just reading for the sex than maybe this would be for you...but really...the story has to be a little better. This is one of the first books I couldn't even read. It was taking me forever to read, and I realized it was because I was so totally turned off by it that I just never made time to read. There are plenty of erotic types stories out there that have a believable and enjoyable plot line...this was not one of them! So, if you are into bad porno-esque plot lines that are put out there to be real...but are totally unrealistic, this may be a book for you. Otherwise, there are way better choices with just as steamy sex scenes.",0

I absolutely hate paying 3.99 for a one hour read with diminishing returns. I'm goimg to rethink buying the rest.",0
1298,2,"Plot/Storyline: 2 StarsThe novel started with a storline that was reminiscent of modern day Lord of the Flies, by William Golding. Unfortunately, that small similarity of teens building their own society is pretty much it for likeness.The premise is faulty from the beginning. A bunch of young kids are camping. I'm not certain of the youngest, but the oldest camper is seventeen. I know at least one is as young as thirteen. Then, when communication is cut off with the outside world, five of the six counselors leave the sixth and youngest counselor, a twenty-year old alone with all those teenagers. I cannot imagine any adults making such a decision.Then, out of all those kids and the one counselor, only one teen decides to try to find out what happened. I would have thought several would have wanted to hike down the mountain to find some adults, but the rest almost immediately start deciding what to do about winter, just assuming they will be there still.Any sense of suspense is ruined constantly by little remarks thrown in referring to things way into the future. The author seemed intent on making sure the reader knew that the kids would never be `rescued' from the very beginning. The kids certainly don't seem very concerned about being rescued with all of them willing to pretty much blindly follow one of the youngest boys in the group.The plot has very little to do with the fog or its origins. It simply focused completely on these kids creating a little society of their own. I will say that it was obvious that a lot of thought and planning went into the storyline. But, the ending was abrupt and unsatisfying.Character Development: 1 StarThe characters were flat and lifeless. The author was disinclined to give any back story on the main characters, so the reader must draw their own conclusions as to the kids' personalities and how they came to be.Writing Style: 2 StarsWhereas the subject matter may not be appropriate for young teens, the writing style was of that type of simplicity. Not only was the sentence structure coarse and unrefined, but the flow came in staccato bursts that was just exhausting to read. The time flow explanations were confusing, too.The descriptions were so sparse that I could not picture a character or a scene during the entire novel. The dialogue was decent in some places, but mostly stilted and uninteresting.Editing/Formatting: 4 1/2 StarsThere were a few editing errors throughout, but not enough to be a big issue. The formatting was of professional quality.Rating: PG-17 for Violence, Rape, and Adult Situations",0
1299,1,"Wow, first off daryle-seems like the author just put some random letters together to create that name. Secondly, the grammar is terrible! When characters speak, it's ""blah blah blah.""

The reader is also shortchanged by Nates' increased sense of smell. Really? Joe made such a big deal of potential changes in human mates, then a better sense of smell is thrown in as an afterthought. The conclusion to the Teacher and Roger problems was messy. It felt like the author was rushing to meet deadline, not honoring the story. Editing was also sloppy,do not rely so much on spellcheck.

1303,2,"This one fooled me.  I did not realize it was really the words for a comic book.  The author explained that at the end.  Sorry, it would have made an interesting sci fi story if written from a different angle.  A world full of action heroes... imagine that!!",0
1304,2,"I agree with other reviewers that feel the heroine's actions went so far beyond the constraints of the social codes of her time (especially given the girl's upbringing, sweet nature and supportive family as implied by the author's words) as to make the book too unrealistic to enjoy.  I am usually quite forgiving in such matters - if the greater story is well done, I am uncritical of minor slips in historical accuracy - so understand that this one, aforementioned departure, is quite egregious.If the author had made the setting a fantasy world and thrown in some additional elements to make me believe that this was a ""regency-like"" fantasy world.  OK.  If the author had made this a longer story so as to develop plausible explanations as to how the heroine could get to that point.  OK.I thought the idea behind the story was a good one.  There was potential here and I wanted to like this story, I just couldn't get past the heroine's implausibly salacious forwardness with the hero.  I was unhappy with the quality of this book when I got it for free.  I think it's definitely overpriced now at 99 cents.",0
1305,2,"I really wanted to like this book, as I am a sucker for books set in Southern California, especially places where I either lived or visited many times. Palm Springs is in the latter category. While the opening chapter had promise, with its details of the real estate industry that ring true to me, the rest of the book was very disappointing.First of all, if the book was written in 2004, and there is no indication that it is a period piece set in the 1960s-1980s, then why name the protagonist Henry (outside of the royal family, I don't know many Henrys, especially one born in 1942: book set in 2004, Henry is 62, etc). And his wife's name was Irma? Why not Cynthia, or Nancy, or Linda -- names that were popular during the 1940s and don't have a whiff of the 1920s or 30s about them. They were married in the late 1960s -- not right after VJ Day! This may seem minor, but I have little interest in reading about a Henry, or an Irma, even though she dies before the story opens. It ages them for me --- gives, at least to me, an impression of a really, really old married couple.Next, there is far too much detail about the little things in Henry's life -- the razor Henry uses, what kind of sandwich old Irma ate before she died in their Las Vegas hotel room, the list goes on and on. As another reviewer noted, this seems like padding to bring up the word count. And the author jumped around with the back story on Henry and Irma -- I thought we were through with the back story, and there it comes again, right in the middle of Henry walking around the house where the murder took place.I am glad to read that the author is going to revise this book. I hope that he tightens the action, and doesn't give us every little detail of Henry's morning rituals, etc. as though he were Marcel Proust. As to the names --- well, we are probably stuck with them....I will keep checking for the revised version, as I still am hooked on the setting, and I admire anyone who takes the time to write and publish, knowing that he or she is opening themselves up to criticism.",0

The heroine is weak and a bit silly and the characters too stereotyped.I thought I would enjoy this unusual plot which of course ended traditionally in spite of the author's effort to make it different, but unfortunately it was a bit of an effort to get through it.",0
1319,2,"I found this book on the Amazon forums and  the character of Octavia was likened to Nero Wolfe. The premise of the book sounded so good that I immediately bought it and started reading. Well, I was very disappointed. Mike, the poetry professor who is going to get in a lot of trouble, is very unlikeable. He is an elitist snob, simply put. In my opinion, he's a wimp who has paid no attention to what has been going on right under his nose for years and cannot understand why his life is being ruined. Then we have Octavia. Yes, she is brilliant...but not brilliant enough to see what is going on under her nose.  She is mean and downright cruel at times, and nothing that she does is done out of the goodness of her heart. That certainly didn't make me like her. She, at least, is a more interesting person than Mike, and has more substance. The concept of this book had so much going for it but I didn't like either Mike or Octavia and had no respect for the wormy, elitist Mike. I didn't find these characters to be sad because they both were self-indulgent and were quite happy being who they are.  The sex in this book is also self-indulgent behavior, but that  didn't bother me. The way these people treated each other did. I wouldn't want to meet them in real life. This book is tagged as dark comedy. Dark yes, comedy...well, I didn't find anything in this book funny at all, not even subtley so.I would have given this book more than two stars because the writing is done well and the story premise is good, but if this is a ""noir"" crime mystery,  count me out of the  group of those who like dark, edgy, self-indulgent, sex with anyone, anyhow writing--anytime. Give me Archie and Nero any day of the week. I prefer characters who have at least some redeeming values. Neither Mike or Octavia did. In order to give a book more than these two stars, I have to care about the people in it, and they have to leave something of themselves for me to remember them by when I am finished. All these people left me with is a bad taste in my mouth.",0
1320,2,"I really was looking for more of a tribute to the lost lives but this just seemed to be a searching for love in all the wrong places type book.The brutality toward the main character close to the end of the book, it just seemed exaggerated and taken out of an old movie or something.Too many lose ends and just matter of fact emotions.",0
1321,2,"I am a big fan of Andrew Grey's novels, and this was the first one that I did not really like.  It had an interesting idea for the plot, but I did not feel it was developed to the fullest potential.  I thought the book was over before it began, and I wish there had been more detail, and that I could have come to know Darren and George better.",0
1322,2,". . . but I didn't.  There are quite a few flaws in this book, the most obvious being: Scene breaks/transitions--there are a few, but for the most part there aren't any; Poor editing, the book is riddled with instances of wrong word choices--I suspect from over reliance on spell checking programs, since the things I'm referring to are things like using ""he"" in place of ""the,"" ""hear"" in place of ""her"" and ""to"" in place of ""too""; the final glaring problem I'll mention is the fact that the story reads like a mish-mash of ""Firefly"" and ""Battlestar Galactica"" with a dash of genetic engineering horror added in for a Geiger-esque effect.It's rather disappointing.",0
1323,2,I gave this collection two stars because of the uneven quality of the stories. The ratio of bad to good was too much.,0
1324,2,"The idea of the book sounded great, a little mystery with a little romance. Unfortunately it just didn't deliver. There was no flow to the book. Seriously lacking a smooth transition when going from scene to scene. The characters were good (could have used a little more build up but its short so I understand), the story idea was good, delivery was just poor. Wish I could say better but I wouldn't recommend it.",0

Between the characters not believing their good looks, to how willing to keep secrets and to die for one another. It was the whole story and it seems that this theme continues on. I will not be reading the sequels. It is redundant and frustrating that these two characters will continue to make the same mistakes just to continue sequels.Some of the book was gripping and I was emotionally vested, but then they flipped the story at the end I lost interest. Read only if it is free. Then form your own opinion wether you will continue with the series.",0
1327,2,"Nothing exciting. I bought this book thinking it was about Atlantis. The story line is normal and nothing exciting unless you are a mountain climber or a flyer , even then it is a tad boring.",0
1328,1,I had great expectations of this book after reading some of the reviews but was greatly disappointed. It seems that the author takes too much care to set the atmosphere of the 19th century and it's customs that she does not give enough passion to the story. The whole story revolves around the pursuit of the main character towards his abandoned wife but there isn't any pleasure in the chase. I have to say I was rather bored when reading this book. It definitely held a promise but failed to keep it.,0
1329,2,It was available for free on kindle so I just bought the book. The book has two many words that make no sense at all. The story seems complicated and going nowhere . I felt a bit disappointed. Not recommended.,0

I came away from this book still in a fog about the characters and their lives. Are they staying together?not?maybe? Does anyone know they are gay? I'm just confused. You decide for yourself, I'm stumped.",0
1331,2,"Not much to it, I must say. I didn't expect much to happen in such a short story, but the writing is not strong either. There was no flavour, no spark in the sex scenes, just a bland description that left me wondering when the hot parts were going to come, if at all.",0
1332,2,"This story started well, but it is too short, with too many unaddressed issues. I think if this were developed into a full length book it might be good, and the premise was interesting. The author writes with good wit. I might be persuaded to read something else by the author, if it were full length to show case his talent. This story seemed to be missing a middle part, with only a beginning and an only vaguely related ending.",0
1333,2,"I've just stopped reading at 53% into story.I am having soooo much trouble reading this due to incorrect grammar, spelling and punctuation.The biggest roadblock in the way of me finishing this book are the inconsistencies in the story.I've just decided to check reviews to see if the problems I'm having reading this have put anyone else off as well. I laughed when I read another review saying they'd stopped reading at 53% as well!The proof reading could be the problem. Some sentences are actually repeated nearly exactly a paragraph or two later, with a slight change in the direction. Its like the author has thought of a better  way to word it but doesn't delete the original sentence.The concept is great, and the story telling creates great visuals for me.  Its just that theres way too much rambling.  Its a wonder Ebony can actually walk in a straight line with the amount of time she spends in her own head.  I've had to stop ready and flick back through the story three times because the sentence I've just ready totally contradicts what was written previously.Ebony is annoying...well the mistakes in the story make her less loveable. But, I'm probably much older than the intended audience so, as this book is free, maybe give it a go if the description has caught your attention.I'm still not sure if I'm going to finish the book or not. I'm pretty stubborn about giving a book a fair chance though.  So far I've been skipping paragraphs, I've even just glanced at a page or two before skipping ahead. I may just read the last chapter...",0
1334,2,"The author had a good initial idea for this story, but fell down on the execution.It's about a young college student with a secret.  A cute frat boy invites her to a party, but betrays her brutally.  Each stage of the story is rushed and there are some elements that defy belief (did she really think the punch at the party would be non-alcoholic?  and, if it was so important for her not to drink, why is she not able to taste alcohol at all?).There is extreme brutality in this story and it is as if the author can't decide whether to dwell on it or skim it, giving the story a strange halfway feeling.  It's too rushed and sketchy for adult readers and it's too graphic for younger readers.",0
1335,2,"The story started out as many Harlequin Romances do.. with a woman mistakenly pulled onto a romance... However the writing in THIS book just shows that the author either hasn't been in love EVER.. or English is their second language and the google translate didn't work well for them on some days.. The plot has so many possibilities, but the writing style, and the understanding of how the love/hate relationship in a romance , works, is lacking...alot!",0
1336,1,"This was really bad, so bad I made it to 59% and stopped in disgust. The tone of the book is juvenile, the characters are extremely childish, they giggle and carry on. The story is not historically accurate for the time, they spend way too much time alone with no chaperones. The plot is weak, a house party, thats it. The dialogue is even childish right from the beginning when the hero's brother is dying. It is,supposed to be sad but it is so overdone and cheesy, it is what a 14 year old would think is dramatic. Poppy comes off as a flighty ninny, all her friends too. They are yappy. Declan is just kind of sleezy going after the young sister of his best friend, sneaking into her room the first night he meets her.At 59 % the house party is having a play put on by the girls, pages of bad acting that is supposed to be funny. (Again, juvenile humor level) Then poppy meets declan in the library where they kiss and makeout, then it goes into detail how he goes back to his room and masturbates while thinking of her.hey I know thats human nature, but the tone of the book is very childish and then it gets graphic and trashy.Not enough depth or talent to make this worthwhile, even for free.",0
1337,2,"UPDATE OF AN UPDATEOk one day after I wrote the update below these died!!! These were not abused by me. I honestly cannot recommend a purchase of these with such a quick failure. I mentioned in my review that I would buy these again if they failed....Well, I have changed my mind.Why is it so hard to find a durable headphone?**** update****I'm one month in with these headphones and I want to talk about durability. So far these are still working great! They seem like I will get a few months out of these... I will keep you updated!I love Moshi products and these headphones are no exception. I got them in the beautiful Pink color.These arrive nicely packaged with three different sized ear buds.The right side ear bud is color coded (the left side is clear) so that you know instantly which ear to place the bud in. Most ear buds I have tried in the past fall off and get lost within days of purchase...not these! These stay on , their on there super tight! Cord is slightly thicker than most and a nice length.I use these with an ipod touch and the mic button works flawlessly to pause music.Their best feature??? These are L O U D !!! So many times I have purchased headphones and I can barely hear them.These are loud and block out most outside noises. I wear these for about 7 hours a day (at a very physical job) and they are comfortable.They stay in for the most part.I find that leaving just a bit of slack ( up near your ear )  in the cord helps them stay in better.Oh I am really private about what I'm listening to on my iPod. When these headphones are out of your ear there is no sound transmitting through them. It's great when you only can wear one earphone.Oh the case is really cool too.I find that with a bit of practice it becomes habit.Though I just pop the buds into their holes and wrap the cord vertically around the whole thing .Its nice not to have a tangle to deal with later.I got these to review  but I did check out the current selling price ( about forty dollars) I feel that might be a bit overpriced.Though if I were to lose them I would replace them at full cost.",0

1339,2,"As much as I hate to call any book boring, sometimes, that's just what it is.  You have a hero (Hawksley) who is returning to society after the death of his father and brother and a heroine (Poppy) who has had three seasons and still has not found the love of her life.  Poppy convinces her brother to allow her to invite females to his house party.  Poppy plans to use this as an opportunity for matchmaking with her friends.The tension between Poppy and Hawksley is excellent.  Their attraction and love match is genuine.  The problem, however, is that this story goes nowhere.  Other than the interaction with the girls' school, all the characters do is participate in a house part of several weeks.There is another love match that occurs between two people who love each other, but due to a misunderstanding have not done a good job of conveying their feelings.  This party provides the perfect venue to set things straight.  To be honest, this side story was one of the better components.The rest of the story just plods along.  The author provides the HEA, but the ending at Hawksley's home is a bit forced.  Perhaps the marriage should have occurred earlier and more time spent at the hero's estate would have helped the story a bit.In conclusion, I say pass on this one.  Any redeeming quality it may have had is mitigated by the lack of editing.  The more the story progressed, the more egregious the errors.",0

1343,2,"I've read longer works by Ms. James, and found them unmemorable.  Novels take more skill than might appear--developing characters the reader can like or dislike, or in some way find interesting enough to continue turning the page. As I recall, she doesn't particularly excell in the long form. I gave this work a try, hopinng Eloisa James's forte might be in the shorter work.  While it is difficult to develop characters much in the time and space contraints of the novella, one would hope for interesting characters, at least.  Ms. James has fallen to the temptation of crafting paper doll characters: all rather shallow and incredible extremes.  The husband is rough and evil, but not entirely so.  His successor is suave and courteous, but not particularly so.  The protagonist (there are actually two and a half) is a man who apparently has grown and changed very little from boy to man, yet we are supposed to root for him.  The heroine has changed not at all from girl to wife to widow.  She is simply confused and lustful.  Sorry to 'spoil' the plot for you, but read it yourself and see if you find it any more satisfying.",0

Too many people, (lots related to each other in vague, unexplained ways) cliched characters & situations, (super rich! supper poor! movie stars! bad people!) & a jump around method of writing that you're never sure who you're reading about. I bought the book not knowing it was only 26 chapters of an ongoing serial novel, so even though much(too much) is made of the fact that several of the charcters eats lots of cereal, the title is a sly play on words. I went to the site (as directed @ the 'end' of the book) & discovered that the book is on chapter 223 now.The few lines I read of chapter 223 had brand new characters, as if the first 26 chapters hadn't introduced enough already.

1353,2,"This particular part of the series is a novella. I read it after purchasing in bundles the entire series; thus laboring through the set. I did like the characters and enjoyed the stories. What I began to find annoying was the regular promises made to leave matters in the hands of the police and an immediate move to be involved. There is just so long readers can tolerate the same irritating habit and supposedly crossed fingers behind the back--high school behavior. It would not be hard to realize when one is not good at the investigating or actually makes matters worse. That should be enough to discourage the detective yearnings. What the lead character was good at was coming up with ideas and questions which she could have passed onto her policeman husband to follow up. Must admit I tired of what I deemed inappropriate times to wear high heels, but guess that was essential considering the title of the series.",0

Nothing else happens, there's no point to this story. No substance at all. We know a food fight is going to happen because the author has put as much effort into coming up with a title as she has into the story itself.  If maybe she had called this Holiday Meal or something else, and the food fight was a surprise there might have been something to get out of this.  We don't know the characters before hand so have no attachment to them, maybe if the story had been padded out a bit with other stuff before the food fight then the participants actions may have meant something to us.  It's like a scene taken out of a longer piece, and it means nothing on its own.  It's not even a good food fight! Even though it only takes up a few minutes to read, give this a miss!",0

1371,1,"I effing hated this book! The characters are so juvenile and immature. The only reason I forced myself to continue reading this whole joke--which only fueled my anger--was because I had hoped they would grow and mature. Their issues, especially the heroines, are petty and insignificant like those of a tween with her first zit and equating it to the end of the universe.The writing was okay, but dialog was pretty crappy. Fraught with too many Uh's and Um's for my taste... kind of like that of a child who's vocabulary hasn't been expanded on by education yet. Editing is excellent! It's odd... great books are always poorly edited and poor books are always superbly edited in my experience. Oh well. Unless you like to read YA's with child-like characters, I do NOT recommend this book. I certainly won't be reading the other books in the series because, judging by the other characters in this one, they're all of questionable maturity as well. Except Will...maybe.

Troy Youngwolf has never stopped loving Breanna, but a youthful drunken mistake forced him to marry her best friend. Something that Breanna has never forgiven. But he's a widower now with a daughter and he's determined that Breanna give him another chance. Breanna can't wait for the wedding to be over so that she can get out of town as quickly as possible and away from Troy. Although she still has feelings for Troy, she can't get over his betrayal and no matter what he does or how he tries to explain, she simply wants to leave. Preferably before he breaks her heart again.I have to say, I usually really, really enjoy Elaine Hopper. As soon as this came across for review I wanted it. However Always a Bridesmaid left me feeling more frustrated than happy. I could have easily forgiven Troy his mistake but his late wife was such a cardboard character and the reasons beyond ""he was drunk"" were never really provided. So I never really felt that the book delivered the character depth that I needed to get past the betrayal and see him as hero material. Especially considering the way he just up and married without giving Breanna any warning. And without that depth I was frustrated by the constant barrage of characters who were on to Breanna to just forgive as if she was somehow in the wrong. Ms. Hopper still can put together a compelling storyline, but Always a Bridesmaid just missed the mark for me.MelissaReviewed for Joyfully Reviewed",0

The female characters are whiny and/or bitchy, abused and scarred by their past to the point of annoyance. They browbeat or guilt trip the male characters so much that everything good about them is erased. Basically the female lead repeats the same complaints over and over while the male conforms and apologizes.

It was like a bunch of short stories were put together which came out of the same milieu but with no thought to how they fit with each other.

And that sure wouldn't take precedence over my LIFE!These far fetched stories are really getting on my nerves. And these Naughty Nooners are notorious for it. Of course, I have found one or two that actually were good. But wading through all this smut is getting to me.READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!",0
1387,1,"I slogged all of the way through it and am not sure why.  It might have been in interesting idea but to say it was poorly executed would be an understatement.  If you are going to write a book based on the concept of all legal marriages being arranged by the government then wouldn't it make more sense to have the book be about mature adults who are ready to settle down?  I have never listened to such a whiny, immature, drunken brat who was less prepared to make a commitment than Rainy, our main character and narrator.  She and her childish behavior totally ruined what might have been a good story.  Her friends were no better, between casual random hooks ups, near constant drunkeness, and an unplanned pregnancy that is treated as---well, it really isn't treated as anything other then something that may make someone look fat in the wedding pictures.I managed to skim through to the end---enduring poor editing and obvious inconsistancies along the way---in the hopes that there would be some unexpected twist to save the story.  There wasn't.",0
1388,2,"I thought this book was a disappointment.  The hero 'fell in love' waaay to quickly. The heroine was too wishy-washy. And she let him walk all over her. Even tho, at times, she would say to herself how much she didn't like it, she still let him do it.Not enough mystery with regard to the murder. Although there was another murder linked to the initial murder, it was weak. It wasn't difficult to figure it out, almost from the beginning.At least it was a free book.",0

1390,2,"I thought it's a crime thriller. When &#34;elves&#34; were mentioned, I thought it's a metaphor. But it turned out to be a supernatural novel with elves and a beast.There are some loose ends the author didn't answer. For instance, Izzy suspected someone was helping George to get in the building. Nothing was mentioned about it afterwards.Some plots are hard to believe. Why did the police not take the case seriously? How did George and his car hide in a small village where almost everybody knew everybody else?",0

1392,2,"If I were a seasoned exercise aficionado, I might be able to follow the workout instructions in this 'vook'.  (I'm not clear on what makes it a vook, but that's not important.)  The author's diet advice is fairly standard, even if few follow it.  The exercises, which constitute half the book, may or may not be sound.  Taken literally, most of them are impossible to execute.  I would say this author might benefit from a better editor or a co-author or ghost writer.",0

1396,2,This author simply writes in a style that doesn't work for me. I thought the characters were shallow and not very likeable. I like to feel something when I read. This was just words on a page.,0
1397,1,"I bought this because I thought the plot had the potential, but it was really just a tried and true idea, driven into the sands of Egypt.You would think that between two authors, one of them would have had an education in elementary writing. I know everyone complains that inexpensive Kindle books can't be expected to be well edited, but come on. Commas aren't just pretty things to be inserted where they look nice. They actually do serve a grammatical purpose. if you're going to submit a manuscript for publication, at least run it through a grammar checker.And I can't say enough here about character development, because there isn't any. The two main characters do, say and think everything together. Mitch and Alex did this, Mitch and Alex did that, Mitch and Alex said this, etc., etc. The supporting characters' main function is product placement to defray the costs of the upcoming ""blockbuster"" movie.Clearly there is a sequel to this book coming, but it's completely obvious who and why from the get go.Like I said earlier, a waste of time.BTW, ""anyways"" is not a word!",0
1398,2,This story is pretty tame. I did'nt really understand the attraction between the h/H. She's a librarian & he's a writer in residence at the college. The premise is great but the delivery lacked something. The love scenes are pretty low on the steam scale & of course there was the obligatory club scene.,0

1403,2,"Ugh, not sure where to start. I am a sucker for these types of stories... someone goes through hell, or has a tormented past and has someone or meets someone to help them overcome... ending in love! But I found this book making me angry, I found the characters unbelievable, mainly on how they talked and how their conversations went. I think someone else commented on that also, which almost made me not give this book a chance... but I did anyway. I think another thing that made me angry was, I am *****POSSIBLE SPOILER****** not a fan of D/s and that's where it all led too and for it to be used to help overcome someones hell of being kidnapped and tortured... sexually and mentally... yeah, didn't set to well with me. And if I read or hear someone refer to someone else as 'my boy' I think I will lose my lunch... really? Does anyone really say that? The term was slightly over used. I so wanted to like this book, but I am sad to say I didn't, sure it kept me reading, to find out what would happen, but when I realized it was headed to where I was hoping it wouldn't... it just left me disappointed.",0
1404,1,"This story was stupid. It made very little sense, no real explanation about what was really going on or who the guy was or even what happened to the main character. This book in no way makes me want to read anything else that would explain those questions. I truly wonder how this book won any awards because I couldn't find anything good or interesting about it. The only good thing about it was that it was free.",0
1405,2,"It's hard to give a bad review to something I got for free but this was a poor product at any cost.The style of writing was dodgy, the characters were forgettable, and the story line was like reading the campaign notes of a D&D; group. Nearly the entire book feels like a bad fan fiction for Firefly (and actually that would have been better).I really did enjoy the universe. The characters all had a lot of potential. This series has a lot going for it. Potential isn't enough though. The series really needs an editor.",0
1406,2,I just couldn't get interested in ths book.  It started off real slow and didn't seem to pick up any speed.  Not impressed,0
1407,2,"First, I will say I downloaded all three novellas in the Moon Trilogy and have read them all. The summaries seemed interesting and the free price...well you can't beat that.However, I was not impressed with the novellas. They were just OK. The idea behind each of the stories is great and have excellent potential. The execution of the idea is where the problem begins.This trilogy is marketed as novellas and rightfully so. They are very short, couple hours read at most. However, just because they are novellas does not mean the story has to be shorted.I felt that Black Moon, especially, was shorted. There is very little if any character development. There is no build up to the intimate scene between the two main characters. Basically, they meet, are immediately attracted to one another and then have sex. There is very little background to add to the characters. They are a bit bland, and left me wondering who they really were. The secondary characters are also very bland with very little said about them than they're the bad guys. I think there should have been more background there as these secondary characters (the wolf pack) come back further into to trilogy to play a more prominent and vital role in the overall story.The plot felt too rushed. The sex scene took up to much of the overall story. I felt much of that could have been used to further the storyline and build a better plot. It starts out good and on the right path then the middle just stalls out on the sex scene and the ending feels rushed. It's like the final showdown or the finale is there and then just as quickly over. The build up to it is bland as well.As the first of the trilogy, this book should have had more insight into the overall plot of the trilogy, the importance of the book as well as the other two pieces, which our the primary premise behind the next two books. It should stand alone, but at the same time intrigue the reader to want to read more. This one did not, and book two almost seems more of a first book into the trilogy with Black Moon not really fitting in. It's was kind of like Black Moon was written and then the author got the idea for the rest of the trilogy but didn't go back to smooth out Black Moon to fit in and lead into the rest. I would say book two and three were better with more defined and developed characters and better plot execution.There are also many editing issues. A simple proofread before publishing would have corrected much of this. The editing does seem to get better as the trilogy moves on, however. The editing issues are a bit distracting at times, but I have seen much worse.On the upside, the storyline and the world created are excellent, unique in their own right, and intriguing. And, this could very well be my main problem with these novellas. I was very interested in the overall storyline and the world created, but left feeling shorted. Like there was so much more that could have been done with this story. Honestly, I think the overall storyline would have been better served as three full books with better development and more defined detail. I just felt there was too much missing and left untold like this was the cliff notes version.I have read other works by this author, and find some of them to be much better. Actually, I've just purchased another of this author's works. I don't think this was the author's best work, but I feel it could very well have been if it had been better planned and prepared.Overall, it's not a bad read...just not a great read, but for the price it's not a waste.",0
1408,1,I gave this 3 stars in my original review and the author went psycho with all kinds of comments and accusations. He enlisted friends to join him and they all seemed to think it funny. I can't support or recommend an author who goes ballistic over a 3 star review. You shouldn't either.All my original review said wasNot a book--it's 3 chapters from another bookI've read and enjoyed lots of fantasy books. This though was not nearly as well done or as well written. Also none of the reviews or the description state this is only a few chapters from another book. I thought it was a complete book.,0
1409,1,This starts out with M/F and M/F/F scenes that are not mentioned in the description. The actual M/M section is so juvenile as to be unacceptable. It's difficult to accept that this author has had any kind of sex with any kind of person. I returned it.,0
1410,2,"This was not a romance, rather it was all about the sex.  They do it in the ally in front of a stranger while he... ahem... just guess.  Then she uses toys on the Vampire....the kind that homosexuals use...during sex. He calls her a whore while they do it..... Just distasteful.Tina Folsom has written some of my favorite books and the writing and storyline in this book were good.  It's just too bad that the disgusting sex habits ruined the characters for me.",0
1411,2,"Much like reading the scenes from a porn movie, from the woman's point of view, written with women in mind. Thank goodness for Kindle as I would never have even considered bringing this into the house as a physical book (not that I would have been missing much if I hadn't read it). I don't think I'll be keeping it on my kindle, but I don't care that it was a single read book as it was free from Amazon.",0
1412,1,I bought this book thinking it was going to be a utopian book but instead got a very boring book with no purpose to it. I do not reccomend this book at all.,0

1414,2,"This book contains three interwoven stories about a rural part of lowcountry South Carolina. The stories are all historical, ranging from lost loves to Confederate ships felled by naval blockades. While the title suggests that the main thrust of the book is ghost stories, I would consider it to be more local history or folklore. Much of the story is not about after-death activities, but about what now-supposed ghosts did in life, and how they eventually met their ends. Really the stories are more legends of the past, told very much in an oral history tradition. The author displays a strong understanding of the history of the region.That said, I found it hard to connect with these stories. Perhaps that's because I was expecting a more traditional ghost story. It might also be because I've never much had an interest in traditional storytelling, and reading this felt more like listening to a storyteller than reading.I would recommend this book to people who have a particular interest in this region, the sorts of readers who would read a local history of the region.",0
1415,2,"I thought this would be a very interesting read, given that's Mark Twain, but I found that I couldn't get into it. The humor was a little too obvious, setting up thinly drawn &#34;characters&#34; from the beginning.",0
1416,2,"Most of the stuff in this book is going to be old hat to readers and more exotic practices are covered so quickly that I pray nobody would give them a go after reading a paragraph of instructions.

1418,2,"Sophisticated Stephanie has spent most of her life proving that she is worthy to take over her father's business.  Little did she know that the foundations of her world begin to shake when hunky Quintin storms into her office to insist that she breaks off her relationship with his 17 year old son, Rob. Rob who?!?! The pair then tries to find ways and means to get rid of Rob's fixation on Stephanie. Quintin then slowly begins to realise why Rob is so fixated with Stephanie, but will he be willing to clash with his son over Stephanie's affections?What a pity.  The beginning of the book started off with quite a lot of promise, but unfortunately, the story started to falter and limp its way to a rather bland conclusion. A rather bland read and I was barely able to finish the book (and only did so as I had nothing better to do that day). You really just wanted to smack some sense into all the characters and tell Rob to grow up and stop being a whiny kid.",0
1419,1,"This is exactly the kind of story my husband always accuses me of reading when I'm not, I prefer something with a little more substance.The story was better suited for a full length novel, but it was clear what the intentions were here.Read it if it's still free for Kindle.",0
1420,2,"There is nothing here that's remotely interesting beyond the travelogue of Australia. The author calls it a romantic comedy; for the life of me I could not find a single thing that was funny - only boring. The book seems like an attempt to preach some sort of message about love and relationships, but the the characters come across as two-dimensional, too serious, too predictable, too stilted, too artificial, too asexual, too pure. Honestly, if I ever met somebody like Drew I'd get as far away from him as fast as possible. He'd bore me to tears. She probably would too.",0
1421,1,"Maybe it was the double-spaced lines, or maybe the lack of continuity in the story but I just couldn't read this beyond a few pages.  The authors failed to establish who they were, where they were and why we should care.  It just wasn't interesting.",0
1422,2,"First off, this author has done an excellent job of her writing. It is carefully edited and obviously she took time to make sure it flowed well together. I think you will either love this or hate it though. I love love love an alpha male, but Travis is a bit beyond alpha male and just plane mean at times and instead of just being really possessive and strong, he tends to be mean and forceful. For example the line ""And when you get back to the house, you better make me something real sweet for dessert, because i want something for all the goddamn trouble you're causing me"". He says this after she was worried about him and so brought him a lunch to where he was working and then grabbed her to make out and she pushed him back when it went to far.Like I said, i love an alpha male, however he really looks at her like she owes him, and I don't like that. She should not have to trade sex for him helping her out. I think she is a great character with depth and character, but I would think she would be afraid of him and not feel any desire.I do want to stress again that the writer does an amazing job of writing, and some may really love this story, especially those that love the alpha male, but he was over the top in meanness for me.",0
1423,2,"I read this one immediately after reading Folsom's Lawful Escort. Venice Vampyr is not as well-written; I didn't enjoy it as much as the previous read. There was very little set-up, minimal character development, and the ""love"" between the two main characters wasn't believable enough for me. I was also somewhat put-off by the sex scenes, as they were not my style. It's interesting to me that this book was released a month after Lawful Escort, because I truly thought this was the older book.",0
1424,1,"I agree with the reviewer who asked why does every hero have to be a slut!!! It was like I could not STOP hearing about his blonde bimbos!!! She was of course, celibate for 8 years and he went through women like a child does candy!!! It was gross and made me believe that he did not have any love for the heroine. I am sick of writers making it look like a man only sleeps with women for a need to be fulfilled. That is not true. Yes, they can keep out the emotional attachments but they still get excited over the woman they are with (they kind of have to). I hate thinking that another woman can so easily take the place of the heroines in these stories. Who cares that there is not emotion in the hero's couplings, he still thinks about how many women he went through and how they dressed sexily when the heroine was wearing comfortable clothes, and let us not forget the thought of how his past women were willing to do explicit things to him!! That was gross and unneeded for the story! I actually started out liking him in the first chapter before it skipped ahead 8 years and to a completely different guy and a douchebag to boot! He also manipulated the heck out of a situation to get his way, harming the heroine and potentially harming the child if the press would have gotten worse. He did not think about anything but himself and his wants. He was NO HERO!!!!",0
1425,1,"I placed one star because you don't have a choice to leave the stars blank.  This book honestly doesn't deserve it.  Although the book is only about 30ish Pages, it was a very difficult read.  The story was disjointed and choppy.  The writing was reminiscent of my 6th grade projects.Understand, I did not pay for this book or I would be demanding my money back.  With that said, maybe I should charge the writer for the very valuable time I wasted.  Even if it is free do not waste your time.",0

1432,2,"I really had a lot of hope for this book.  I felt the author did a good job carrying on the tone of the original Jane Eyre - even though sometimes her use of archaic language seemed a little clunky.

I was left wondering if I accidentally skipped to another book. Yes, the ending is that bad.Did you get bored? I wish you would go back and see this through properly. I wanted to see the relationship between Davey and Cookie be something more. I wanted to see where it would lead. ( In friendship) possibly sparking his memories or persuading him to build new ones.... even if he is dead!You have such potential, in this story and as a writer. Don't hurry endings.",0
1436,1,"This was one of the most frustrating series I have ever read.  How can your heroine of the series not be heroic at all?  This girl is a twit.  She falls for every trap, and is the cause of some of worst events in this series.  I kid you not, she is repeatedly claimed to be this all powerful angel but she only gets in the way of the real heroes of this series.  Everyone around her is smarter than her, it is so ridiculous.  It was not until the 7th book that she actually did anything worthy of a main character, and that was just barely. In the last book so far Toxic 7.5, even the end of that book when she is finally contributing she is pathetic.  You know how when you are reading a book and the main character gets his or herself out of a situation there is in no way they should have been able to get out of, you never have that problem with this book.  You wish she had a little more super in her hero.Usually it takes me less than 4 hours to read a well written 250 - 300 page novel.  I can consume a series like this in a few days at most.  When I tell you it took me one and a half weeks to finish this series, that is not an compliment.  I had to make myself finish this series by the fourth book I was so angry I would just put my kindle down and walk away in disgust. Like I said in the title I am not a quitter and that is why I suffered through this nonsense, this was such a disappointment.  I find it hard to believe that anyone is considering this book series for tv or a movie.  If they do I hope they ditch the dumb heroine theme and they get a girl with a higher IQ and some guts.A good series is Vampire for hire by J.R. Rain. All of his books are pretty good, he has a few other series!  Also JL Bryan The Paranormals and Songs of Magic (kid friendly) series are really good.",0

1445,2,"I bought this because I liked the idea of the street kid and upstanding man going on with it. The first part of the book is pretty good, before anything sexual got involved in it. Then once masturbation and sex is introduced... its just not appealing. I think the authors favorite word is ""rammed"" when from the top of my head I can list a number of alternatives. Maybe it was to describe something rough, but instead it just gives the impression of painful and just... no. From some of the other reviews, Rhone had no prior inkling of being gay, which is true, but there were hints of an attraction to Adam that could have been expanded on. By the end Rhone was very much repeating, ""I don't know why by I'm so attracted to you"" (roughly). By then I was just done with the story. I liked Kasey and Rhone's brother when they interacted, but let me just mildly warn you there is one super-weird scene between Kasey and Adam. It started part way through and I was super put off by the abruptness and randomness of it. This book could have been written better.",0
1446,2,"As a rule, if I do not like a character or the flow of the book I stopped reading. That I finished this book despite my dislikes attests to the author's writing and the story's world.What put me off the book is the heroine's indecisive take on arising issues between her and the hero on the story - always putting it off 'for later consideration' as she puts it. What's worse is her constant hot and then cold to hot again attitude towards the hero who, from the start, told her that he is 100% attracted to her. The attitude was so thinly stretched to me that by 50% of the book it became so old news that I want a new conflict to give the reading journey a fresh breath. It goes on and on until the LAST chapter, and what's more annoying is that she has to be PUSHED by a secondary character to decide. Don't get me wrong, the heroine is decisive as a professional or in her job but it's her emotional hot and cold that ruined the romance in the story for me.And I picked this book because it's listed as ROMANCE and NOT psychology book.The hero himself, though not the usual chest beating alpha male, has a tenderness that coats his inner steel that just melts a woman's heart. I liked him and loved the way the author unveiled his character. I think the author did him justice than the heroine. It was his character that kept me reading and the need to know implied pasts that made him who he is today.The book has funny moments, paragraphs after paragraphs of inner monologue, the main characters chemistry started good - to me, and the whole plot was engaging.Overall, I liked the book and was enjoying it until the heroine's indecisive, hot and cold attitude turns into holier-than-thou attitude soured her character to me.",0
1447,2,"Seems like thus far, I am the only one not praising this book and giving it somewhat of an unfavorable rating.  I'm sorry but this book just did not do it for me.  It was short and silly, and yes there were twists and turns but not enough to impress me.  I don't think I will be reading anymore books by this author.",0
1448,2,"Wanting to know who the murderer was, is what kept me reading.  But the characters were the stupidest I have ever read.  First of all there is no character development.  There is very little background, very little physical descriptions, no reason to like them.  There is no real romance, just a hook up with a hot guy.  There is no reason to root for or even like these characters.  The reason for the heroin's guilt and the killer's hatred for her was stupid.  They were all dumb as a box of rocks.",0
1449,2,"I downloaded Book 1 for free, and was pretty impressed with Evans' writing, so I bought Book 2. However, I felt really let down. It seemed that there was a lot of meandering around, and that Evans hadn't taken the time to properly edit her book. For instance, Chapter 15 on my K3 was underlined all the way through! There were also numerous spelling and grammatical errors. The formatting at the end was abrupt and seemed like Evans had just gotten tired of writing and wanted to wrap up.The plot was also not as interesting as the first one. This time, it seemed that Piper talked an unhealthy amount about her metabolism and junk food (almost on every page) and there was a part where she went off about the death penalty and murder that I found utterly confusing. It was almost like reading an opinion piece.*Spoiler* Also, it seemed convenient that the witch in the book could use his powers when he wanted to do virtually anything, and yet sent Piper on a wild goose chase simply to confuse her and get her executed. Why couldn't he have just staged HER killing to look like someone else had done it and then used magic to deflect anyone off the right path? And the lie detector kid...why did he not see the sword the first time around, while they were in his house? Utterly confusing and not explained.I hope Evans has a professional content and line editor look at her third book. I noticed in the acknowledgements that she had a friend (it seemed like) look over the 2nd one, but maybe a professional would be able to devote more time and energy towards making her books something readers would feel happy to spend their money on.P.S. - Also, I believe the proverb is ""When It Rains, It Pours"" and not ""It Never Rains But It Pours,"" so the title is sort of off, too.",0

1451,2,"This book was so boring and unrealistic! The story line was weak and there was poor development of the characters. It took me serveral days to read it. I didn't think I would be able to get through the entire book. I kept falling asleep everytime I started reading it.  The only reason I completed it, was I didn't want to waste my money. This book would be a good persciption for someone who has insomnia..",0
1452,2,"the verb tense was frequently wrong, at least in the beginning of the book.  &#34;doesn't&#34; where the word should have been didn't...etc.I stopped reading early on because this poor editing was so irritating.it was also irritating that the only man to notice that this woman was beautiful was a man made ugly by his scars, and in the reverse, the only woman to seeming notice that the man was handsome was a Plain Jane woman.I know that this is how it usually is in real life, the stud marries the gorgeous gal, and you rarely see the nerd with the pretty woman, or the Plain Jane with a stud muffin.  our society is so obsessed with appearance.  still, that aspect of the book irritated me as well.",0
1453,2,I am not one to give bad reviews but I could not get into this book.  The sex was hot.  I am not too into m/m sex but in this book it wasn't bad.  you could actually feel for both men.  But Cassie's character I did not like.  She comes into town after being engaged for 10 months and within 5 mins is having sex with Kyle & she was pretty much the one making it happen.  I did not like all her self doubts.  I guess the last chapter was the best in the book.  So all & all it was an okay read but not happy I spent money on it.,0
1454,2,"I can't say I loved it, but I did not hate it...it mostly bugged me...the romance with Serena, Marc and Tony was good, and pretty hot...although the initial lies they told were pretty dumb and as usual come back to bite them in the ass...What I had a hard time with was when so many people in town felt Serena deserved what happened to her, even the sheriff and while it was mostly a small part in the beginning...it just really bugged me...that aside for me the book was just ""meh"" not bad, not great.",0

1457,1,"This review contains a MASSIVE SPOILER that I wish I'd known before I read this book.You've been warned.I read this book b/c I was specifically seeking a story were the lead characters go snowed in.  I got exactly what I wanted.  What I did not want and what gave me a tight, ""I can't believe this, I know this can't be true"" feeling in my stomach that ruined most the book for me was SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER the heroine thought the hero was her half brother for most of the book.  She kissed him and allowed him to fondle her although she thought he was her half brother.  Due to some plot device, she woke up in his bed, and of course he was so glad to see a beautiful woman in his bed in the morning, that he proceeded accordingly.  She did not immediately leap from the bed in horror and dismay.  The touching and arousal (!) continued until it was going to go one way or the other and *then* she got up.  All the while thinking he was her half brother.  This happened within hours of her meeting him.  It is not the only instance of them making out and basically doing foreplay while she thought he was her brother.  Ugh.Basically, this book had an overlay of seeming incest, unbeknownst to him but known to her, for over half the book.  She struggled with it a little, but not really, imo.  Not enough to tell him the truth immediately.  Who does that? To say that I was skeeved out does not even begin to capture it.  I kept reading b/c ""there was just no way"" that they were really related.  Of course, they weren't, but that bad taste in my mouth never left completely.  I really thought less of the heroine for her lack of honesty.  If I'd known that about this issue, I'd have passed on this book.",0
1458,2,it was a bit to scary with all that blood and people that become dead. this might be to scary for some kids.,0
1459,2,"The writing was pedestrian and the story had the emotional depth of a puddle.If you want sex scenes, read it.  Otherwise, pass.",0
1460,2,This book had a real weak story behind it. I really couldn't absorb the characters since the story was how they frequented sex due the strong physical attraction they have for each other. Despite the heroine's past issue it was difficult to get into them later in the book.,0
1461,1,"I had a very hard time getting into this book. So much so that I stopped reading it 65% of the way through a 56 page book. The characters were not at all exicting and the romance, in what I read was a snooze fest.",0
1462,2,"This manifesto offers a set of five suggestions for individuals to increase their happiness and a set of seven suggestions for governments to increase the happiness of their citizens.The first set of suggestions have a common theme: a variety of activities that make many people happier.  However, there is a trade-off here: if a person wants to spend more time connecting, gardening, exercising, taking notice, and learning, they will have to spend less time on expensive consumption such as travel and living in expensive areas of the world.  There's a case to be made for downshifting, but this manifesto avoids confronting the hard choices.This manifesto also leaves out the role of religion in a happy life.  That is an enormous factor.  One can argue against it, but this manifesto just plain omits any discussion of it.  Similarly, having a family is the most powerful source of happiness for many adults, but this work mentions family life only in passing.The second set of suggestions also has a common theme: increase the power and scope of government.  I'm sure this will make one set of people very happy: the government planners.This is a Kindle Single, so it's short (good).  However, after filtering out the glib TED-talk, it's a bit too short.  I'll take a nice slow book such as Walden instead.",0

1464,1,"I own every book this writer has written up to the end of the Jill Kismet series. That series is the best work I've ever read. Intelligent, character driven and a continuous page turner. That is why I don't understand what has happened here. It is like she has started all over and forgotten all the mastery she had attained. I am so, so disappointed and somewhat angry.",0
1465,1,"Taming the Vampire was a short story, that left little thought into the plot. I'm a huge paranormal romance fan. So to have been so disappointed in this book was not good. This is a short story, written well but so predictable not really intriguing the reader. There is a love to hate relationship that we all knew were the relationship was going, I don't like you but I have this secret guess what I really do like you. I could have used more of everything, more depth, more character, more plot. So in the basic review of this book that's just it, very basic. This book received such great reviews on amazon I wonder what people were thinking. I mean if you are just in the book to read it for the sexy. Then by all means take the FREE download and read it. I want a book to have more than just that. So overall I'm glad it was FREE.",0
1466,1,"Humorous, strong overused language, sexual situations. I needed to put that first to make sure your forewarned. The story really isn't that good but the humor of the pranks Linda pulls on her boyfriend after her death make it almost bearable.",0
1467,2,I bought this book after having read 'Bared to you' which was fantastic (although a 'shade of grey').This book has great sex scenes but the story is weak.,0
1468,2,"Having downloaded this book expecting to have a really good read, I was disappointed in how most of the story was depicted.There are some laugh-out-loud moments early on in the story, but after that things seemed to go downhill. I didn't like the heroine, because I thought she was a shallow twit. The hero was okay but a bit of a drongo in that he couldn't seem to realise that he had to actually have some training to run a department store.The romance was not convincing in that the characters hated each other, then liked each other and then hated each other again - and nothing had happened between them except - in time honoured fashion - a misunderstanding which could have been cleared up in two minutes. Of course that doesn't happen in romance books!The managers were unrealistic and silly. Far too many typos in this one and at one time the wrong name was used for a character!The premise was good, but unfortunately the script didn't maintain the fun of the first few chapters.",0
1469,1,"The action in the story takes place over way too short a time to be believable. The heroine feels justified in committing illegal acts to further her ends, and she's the star of a Christian romance? I found it preposterous that she and the hero would fall in love.  The Christian aspects seemed really forced: she doesn't seem to have much faith, and they're constantly praying for miracles, which BOOM arrive right on schedule. The hero seems to exist to be her human ATM, funding her search for her biological sister, and the pray/miracle seems to make God into some sort of vending machine. Then there were plot holes: how did the villain get a copy of a picture of the heroine that had to have been taken years before she met the villain? Why does the hero so readily believe a stranger who accuses his father of a crime? If the author had had the couple meet in a conventional way (easily done) and have a loving trusting relationship prior to the events of the book, it might have been believable, but the story was like being dropped into the front car of a roller coaster as it's cresting the first hill. You're off and running before you have a chance to say 'Wait a minute, how did THIS happen?'",0
1470,2,"Most of the new subplots were supposed to be humorous.  Unfortunately, filling a book with dick jokes limits your audience- the jokes really seemed to be something that would appeal to 19 year old guys.  Anyway, a combination military fantasy and penis humor novel is an odd style choice.  I just didn't find it funny.So on to the writing.  It is very inconsistent.  You will finish reading a paragraph that is just silly and pointless, and then a scene will come up that is really great.  I think the book would benefit from stronger direction, and some ruthless editing.The author continues with the punishment theme, and it gets stretched quite thin.  He does pose some interesting points, but also occasionally contradicts himself.The author relies mostly on primary emotions such as happy/sad/angry and doesn't make much use of subtler emotional distinctions (pensiveness, joy, or even sensuality).  He also doesn't make use of visual emotional cues such as facial expression or body language very often.  It makes his characters seem a bit shallow and incomplete to me (the main character perhaps being the exception).The book didn't have a lot of sex in it, but what there was tended to be violent or unpleasant.  I didn't get that.  Also, everyone falls in love instantaneously and love is almost always unrequited, so there are almost no relationships except for the exceptionally dysfunctional one between the two brothers (later there is also a relationship between two boys.  But adults apparently don't get together long term).  I did not enjoy that.Overall, parts of it were good, but soured by unfunny humor subplots and shallow character development.",0

The main character is responsible for taking care of children but thinks like a child herself.As the book progresses, she grows up a little.

There's a lot of emphasis on her abusive past and her dealing with it in the present.I wouldn't pass it on to another to read.",0

1474,1,"I liked the first few pages of this, then I kept running into the kind of grammatical and spelling errors I would find in a fanfiction by an inexperienced writer.  The one that was the last straw:  gravelling instead groveling.The story has almost direct quotes from Twilight by Stephenie Meyer: ""You don't know how long I've waited for you.""  Ugh.It's another story where the narrator speaks to all this time that's passed but in reality it's been less than a week or two.  Things that should be dealt with in detail are glossed over.  The other reviews speak to how it's a great story etc, but I just don't see it.  Maybe it'll get better, but there are so many other books to be read out there that are good that I can't spend the time hoping this one will get better.",0

And Elizabeth, to say the least, is ridiculous, stuck in a never ending loop of whining that they need to see that she's grown up then throwing a childish temper tantrum and cursing at them. She does this over and over again. She's pathetic. And the brothers are constantly groping her breasts, rubbing up against her, and making out with her while her young daughter is right there-sometimes even in her arms-and she just lets them.I couldn't stand her, the book is not well written, and my money has been thoroughly wasted.",0

1478,1,"While the story has promise it was a difficult read.  The author needs to work on the craft of writing. Many rookie grammar, spelling and storytelling mistakes were distracting.  While in some cases the characters were hundreds of years old they didn't seem to have evolved beyond the consciousness of high schoolers.  Characterizations were also a bit inconsistent.  Political intrigue is not very sophisticated and the ways characters stow away and otherwise sneak around to avoid detection stretches credulity.  I also didn't appreciate descriptions such as ""The Latina woman"", ""the Asian"", or ""the dark man"" to describe every character who wasn't White.  In the meantime, what I assume are white characters had not such descriptions.  I appreciate the attempt but the author needs training.",0

I wouldnt recommend this book, but since its a freebie, it may give you a taste for the author's writing style.",0

That was stated in the book as it began. Gives you the impression that something exciting was going to happen, after all it&#8217;s a thriller. Not the case!  I felt like I was reading a newspaper of current events.The positive point for this book is that it is very short, so it was a fast read.",0

1490,1,"This book was ridiculous.  No matter how the author tried to spin it, Zara was chasing after a married man.  The only time a single woman tries to pursue a friendship with a married man is because she wants to be a little more than friends.  I don't blame Matthew's wife, I would not want another woman hanging around my husband and calling him either.Matthew has feelings for Zara, but I'm not sure what type of feelings since he treats her like an annoyance, nuisance.  The author writes in one sentence how much Matthew misses his deceased wife, then in the next sentence their marriage wasn't doing so well.  He also treats Zara like crap; but then again I kept picturing her as the pathetic little black girl chasing after the white man who makes it very clear that he doesn't want her around.The sex scenes were gross and disgusting.  He came across as a horny man talking as disgusting as possible to, not the woman he loves, but the tart he picked up on the streets.I absolutely could not stand Matthew and I despised Zara.  It was a waste of money.",0

Ive read this author before and was looking forward to reading this short, which is a sample or teaser to the full story.

They start by giving the first book away, practically giving the second one away at only a dollar and by the third book your into the story so much you don't mind the almost four dollar sale price that goes to five once it goes through the bank. In the end of this series you are where I am. Finished book 7.5 and through out the series you have a girl in love with three amazing guys and a very slow story that minuses a few hills and valleys doesn't really go anywhere. You are forever looking for a conclusion to the story that doesn't come.

The heroine did not know her man was a werewolf, and he tells her at their wedding on the day she arrives back in town after not seeing each other for 9 years.  He says Hi we're getting married, ties her up throws her in the car and off they go to get married, and she says ""Where do we stand.""  Ughh!!

1503,2,"OK I was prepared for ""chick lit"" and ready for it to be just another dumb romance, but the treatment of characters and the things they did etc was especially shallow. What I cannot forgive, however, is the misuse of words in a book!!!  Writers need to do more than use spellcheck to find those--they need to actually READ THE BOOK.  They started showing up @ 75%, so for some reason the writer got in a hurry to finish this book. Perhaps they were sick of it too.unforgivable are:peace when it should be pieceshuttered when it should be shudderedsaver when it should be savorknow when it should be nowsummons when it should be summon...And I did not set out to look for errors, these just jumped off the page they were so bad...it disrupts the entire thought process when you run across stupid errors like these.I'm glad I did not pay for this book, as it wasn't worth any money. I will not read anything from this ""author"" again.In this day and age everyone seems to think they can write a book, but it is not that easy to write a GOOD book. I suggest this writer read some very good books to figure out why this stuff is just ""tripe"".  The author needs to take English 101.  The mistakes above are just unforgivable for anyone who purports to be a writer. A high school student could write something like this--and perhaps they did.",0

1508,2,"Since I mostly listened rather than read the book, I have no complaint to make about the editing. Beyond that, however, was the absence of any sense of reality with regard to characters and situations. Without revealing specific situations to the person who will read the book, things happen which cannot possibly be the behavior of  Good Guys, other acts cannot be believed of any police force anywhere in the United States, and, the Bad Guys are caricatures with little credibility.Missed most is the absence of any depth in the characters. None are convincing as feature or even walk-on real people. Only two subordinate players are given any degree of life.The action itself is a confused mish-mash of tech-talk and violence with the Good Guys equipped with with super-gadgetry and the Bad Guys stand-ins from old Keystone Cops routines.No doubt it will please some who, in this instance, are prepared to be generous.",0

And I know I've read alot of books that don't refrain from using it or other choice words.Anyways the idea of the story isn't terrible but I didn't like any of the characters all that much. Everything happened really quickly which it had to since this was a short story. The humorous thing was that Linda the woman that is dead(ish) hung around looking for her body and she was constantly screwing around with her ex-boyfriend/murderer. She was not a great character but once in a while did something funny. Like choosing Mike's wardrobe for court. That was a nice touch.I'm not going to recommend it to anyone because I'd rather save anyone from the trouble of reading it and dissatisfied as well.

1517,2,"I'm sure that ""Twenty-Five Cent Dinners for Families of Six"" by Juliet Corson was a great hit in its day; however, there are few recipes in this 1878 cookbook that any cook would make today. Oatmeal and peas? Sheeps' Head Stew? A pie of pork trimmings? Tripe, Curry and Rice? Suet-laden desserts? Barley water? Suet dumplings? Baked Pig's Head? No, thanks!The book does serve to provide a peek into the culinary practice -- and necessities -- of 150 years ago. This book, unlike Corson's previous cookbook, ""Fifteen Cent Dinners,"" was aimed squarely at the middle classes; even so, cooks in those days were reduced to, for example, preparing a main dish of rice, suet, flour, and molasses (made from a half-pound of uncooked rice and a quarter pound of suet) to feed themselves, a husband, and four children. A large fish had to be stretched into two meals for a hungry family of six. Many of the recipes are stews, broths, and soups made from neckbones. One main dish, a meat brewis -- nothing more than a stale loaf of bread soaked in hot broth and then served -- is lauded as ""satisfactory, nutritious and economical; enough for a hearty meal costing not more than five cents."" If the middle class lived like this, what was life like for the 80 percent that were working class or poorer?Corson's notions of nutrition -- heavy on fats and carbohydrates -- are a world away from ours in most aspects. Yes, Corson gives a nod to fresh vegetables, but few of the recipes feature any and there's no separate category for them as there is for meats, legumes, soups, and desserts. Corson decries roasting and baking -- what we consider the best way to prepare meat -- as an affront to frugality. You can imagine Corson shuddering at such wanton prodigality when she writes: ""The first [roasting] is the most extravagant way of cooking meat, as it wastes nearly one third of its substance in drippings and steam; the second [baking] also is very wasteful, unless the meat is surrounded with vegetables, or covered with a flour paste."" Corson preferred ""[b]oiling food slowly, or stewing it gently, [which] saves all its goodness."" I can't imagine Americans today relishing meats boiled for four to six hours. She also ensures that, in her recipes, ""very little fat is wasted."" Corson loves fatty gravy and ""seasoned suet"" -- whatever that is. Corson also can't resist make a pitch for temperance and against beer. And a glance through the cookbook shows that 19th century women spent HOURS cooking most days. ""Hasty"" pudding takes an hour, to give you an idea of how long.Don't get me wrong: A few of the recipes do still hold up. Corson, ever frugal, lists recipes (""receipts"" in her parlance) for making your own lemon and orange flavoring, vanilla extract, and tarragon vinegar. The rice pudding, bread pudding, fruit dumplings (which one would make with pie crust rather than a suety crust), stewed pears, Strawberry Drops, and most of the desserts look delicious. The Pork Pie, if pork chunks were substituted for pork trimmings, looks appetizing. The Roast Pork and Potatoes (reserved for Sunday) would pass muster today if it weren't cooked for two hours and doused with water.Still, this isn'tJOY OF COOKING, which has held up so well: It's more history text than cookbook.",0

1520,2,"Clich&eacute; Yep this book is a collection of clich&eacute;s.  I have to agree with most of he one and two star reviews given previously to this book.  The clich&eacute;s are not so much vampiric as private detective/spy clich&eacute;s. And I mean every one. Including the ones that contradict each other.Hero is a 130-year-old vampire but seems to have the mental age of about 23.  He is almost irresistible to women when he turns on the vamp magnetic effect.  However, confronted either of the two by the female protagonists he acts and talks like a 20 something geeky kid.He works for a seemingly incompetent and ambivalent controller and governing body.  Weird arguments with these parties and other characters where the hero ends up holding the shitty end of the stick every time and accepts his lot with a ""Oh man this always happened to me."" And then pages of maudlin introspection for example; Hero wants villain vamp to be targeted.  After resistance and inaction the vamp council agree and gives him the job.  He then says this is bad as this guy is hard to take.  So they offer him extra crew to help.  He turns it down because.....wait for it""...........grand clich&eacute; ...ta da.............cue music.... HE ALWAYS WORKS ALONE!!!!!  So they say fine get on with it.  Then he is sad about being under appreciated and used because he has to take on super vamp on his own?????????????? .  (Which I am sure is what he wanted, no demanded.)  Then enter many pages of the maudlin introspection.Puke. This is only one of the many classic detective assassin clich&eacute;s that you get bombarded with.  Are you getting sick of me using the word clich&eacute; yet?  Well you should be and you will be getting the idea about the book.  The clich&eacute;s are mixed in with these ridiculous circular arguments and also amazing (read ridiculous) insights to the detective and assassin role and equally amazing insights from his mentor the great Zero  ""Didn't I tell you hotel rooms are often traps?""His control is useless being disinterested and lazy and just plain dumb.  Okay the controls are ex agents given the role due to their good service.  So how did this one get through the years of agent training and then live and succeed through hundreds of years of being an agent and then end up fat dumb and happy?  After hero gets his but handed to him for the second time he is convalescing in hospital.  Control visits him.  Hero asks for a bodyguard while he recovers.  Control thinks it is not necessary!!!!!  Then comes one of those whiney circular arguments.  Explaining anything to control is like teaching algebra to a dog.  Also Hero also isn't good at explaining being a maudlin clich&eacute;  factory.The author seems to have meticulously researched theses insights of the detective assassin genre by watching movies and reading crap novels of the genre have.  In fact I think this book is a classic Mickey Malone detective novel from the 1940s with a vampire element thrown in, but not as good.His amazing detective ability leads him to stake out a city nightclub because, well nightclubs are super vamps usual hunting grounds.  There are probably a hundred nightclubs in the city but he guesses right first time and that very night the bad boy turns up.  Man what are the odds?  I mean couldn't the author have even a simple device like a tip off?  Nope.  Just go to one and the bad boy strolls right in. Lazy.He has trained for years and has 30 years actual ""fixer"" experience yet his fantastic skills seem to be in the leaping in the air while wielding a weapon (loosely wielding because they usually get taken off him early in the fight) variety rather than in locating and eliminating the target variety. To locate the target in his world you just seem to go somewhere on a hunch and wait about 5 minutes and target will appear.  Of course he then has no workable plan so everything comes down to a chasing around jumping in windows while the super vamp makes taunts about taking over the world.Then he meets a beautiful female ex KGB assassin.  The clich&eacute;s here are hip deep.  She is beautiful and has been trained in everything by everyone.  She has worked in every cold war battleground as an assassin.  During the Soviet Afghan war she took out a 14-man Afghan guerrilla team that the Soviet Army could not catch one by one.  Man! Teenage wet dream. Again her training also leads her to use the same hopeless strategy the hero does.  Man that KGB assassin training must have sucked.  No wonder they lost the cold war.This book was a bunch of clich&eacute;s put in a box and shaken up.Enough!!!!!!!!!  Get the sample before you buy",0

She's beautiful, innocent (annoyingly innocent) and still they assume they should be allowed to debauch her.

1526,2,"I got 5 books from this series when they were free for the kindle. I will not be buying any more. I've read 5 books and while I enjoyed the first 2, they are fast going down hill. The plot is repetitive; save Maria, find shelter, and no progress is ever made. The characters keep having the same arguments and making the same bad decisions again and again. The sentence structure is awful with words missing or misplaced as well as lots of wrong word choices (passed instead of past, they're instead of their). It is also confusing trying to figure out which book goes first. Chronologically speaking, it seems like ""Villains of the Apocalypse"" should be first. It appears to follow the scientists as they are creating the OZ ""zombie"" virus. The Secret Journal has a part 1 and 2 while the other books are numbered 1 through 4. Maybe the author wrote a prequel and found out they were addictive and just kept writing one more prequel? It doesn't help when most of the books start with a scene and then go back to tell you how they got in this sticky situation.The description on Amazon is a bit vague. Here's another one.Three scientists have developed a virus intended for use as a weapon. They are testing it on various groups that no one should really miss (refugees, terrorists and people smugglers for example). There is a containment breach in the Australian Outback and in a short period of time, the country is overrun with zombies. A media blackout meant to control panic and prevent the story from getting out also keeps most of the world ignorant of the disaster. Most of the story is told from Rebecca's point of view, she is an average 16 yr old girl. Other main characters are: Maria Marsh (another teen with an immunity to the virus), Jack (Maria's boyfriend), Kim (Jack's older sister and a police officer in Sydney) and Kenji Yoshido (Rebecca's 19 yr old boyfriend and a marine sniper). The entire focus of the series is getting Maria Marsh out of Australia to the doctors who will hopefully create a cure.There is a lot of running around Syndey and the Outback trying to escape monsters, looking for transportation, shelter, food and water. You also have religious fanatics sacrificing women and children to the zombies, mutant animals, giant zombies, and rogue nanobots that are animating machinery. I almost forgot, Kenji can see and talk to dead people.",0

1534,2,"For a good portion of his nearly century-long existence, Leo Dunne has been waiting and hoping to catch that one elusive scent that would bring love and joy to his life, the scent of the one person born just for him. When he caught scent of Ruby Halloway, saw her bent over a file cabinet in his company, he knew he wanted her desperately and thought she may be the one. Ruby, who has had a crush on Leo for ages, did what any shy girl would do when the object of her deepest desire focused on them...she ran away and hid.For a year she's avoided him. For a year he's watched her and tried to get close. Finally, with the help of her best friend and all the charm he can muster, the alleged playboy gets Ruby right where he wants her, and when he tastes her lips for the first time he knows he was right. She's his. And there will be no more hiding or running.Unfortunately, just finding his true mate isn't enough. He's still got to tell her he's fae, explain to her his Sidhe mother and leprechaun father. Gently introduce her into a world she couldn't possibly even dream about and explain the benefits and consequences. Before he can even get close to approaching that daunting task, however, his father calls with somber news. A rival family has kidnapped his brother and is holding him ransom. Leo doesn't need to ask what ransom they're asking for his brother's release. He already knows.They want him.Dana Marie Bell has kicked off this new series with a lot of potential and the backbone of an intriguing world and fun mythos, populating it with personable characters and a couple of neat plot twists. I've long been a fan of Bell and have read and enjoyed her Halle Pumas and Halle Shifters (looking for more of that one!) series, and am familiar with her writing style and characterizations. I particularly enjoy the humor that she injects and how adeptly she partners humor with stressful, sometimes threatening situations, to the benefit of the story as a whole.She's done that here in Dare to Believe: The Gray Court, Book 1. I enjoyed Leo and was charmed by Ruby, who, despite her shyness and some issues with body image, was an appealingly silver-tongued quipster who was good for a cute, humorous line. Some of Bell's greatest strengths as an author lay in her abilities to write fun, bantering dialogue and provide appealing and individual character definition around a solid story concept or idea.The depth and breadth of the plot suffers, though, by this book's shorter length. The narrative doesn't do much to flesh out the developing story and too much of it remains bare-boned to the point of emaciation. The pacing is disjointed, coming in forced fits and starts, not always clearly defined and suffering from several awkward transitions. Creating the world for the series, then stuffing a satisfying romance and a dangerous family threat together is a good idea in theory, but that's a lot of story and there just wasn't room to tell it all fully - to the detriment of the whole thing. Bell has the skill to tell a fully developed story that satisfies on all levels. She's done it before. Had she taken another 100 or so pages to fill out this story, she could have done so here.Unfortunately, as it stands, the romantic couple comes together far too quickly for my personal tastes, Ruby accepts her new world and gets over a lifetime of insecurities far too quickly for my tastes, and the kidnapping plot thread starts, and ends, with far too little development and depth. What's most disappointing is that with the appeal of the characters, I wanted much more of them and was doubly disappointed for not getting it.And then there's the sex.I vacillated on how to classify the genre of this book. Technically, there's too much plot and story development for me to consider it erotica in the manner in which I normally make that determination. There are also, however, sex scenes far too graphic and unconventional to fit into a mainstream paranormal romance - or even an edgy paranormal romance. I don't mind that - I like erotica. The problem is, though, that in this book there is a sex scene that is so egregiously out of place and disparate from the tone of the romantic relationship, the character development, and the plot at the point it was introduced, that I found it jarring and distasteful when read in context.~* WARNING! THERE BE SPOILERS AHEAD!! *~Consider the following: Ruby is very, very shy and sexually inexperienced. Leo has convinced her to go with him across the country because his brother has been kidnapped and he needs to be with his family. He's desperate for her as his mate but desperate to help his brother. He's nervous about telling Ruby he's not human and knows he still needs to do that. Ruby gets to his parent's house and not only is completely overwhelmed by the choices she made to get her to that point, but nearly has a fit when his parents put her in the same room with Leo. She's accosted by the family who kidnapped his brother and Leo bonds with her. The bonding knocks her out for two days and Leo is terrified for her. When she finally wakes up Leo is so relieved that he...grabs the small, sex toy-filled suitcase he brought with him (packing sex toys is, of course, the first thing I think about when I learn my brother has been kidnapped and know it's because of me), unpacks an alarming number of them, blindfolds and handcuffs Ruby to the bed, uses a feather duster, rabbit ear vibrator, and anal plug on her, then proceeds to introduce her to...enthusiastic anal sex in concert with the other toys.Um...yeah...that didn't really work for me. On any level. At all.Had it been a different couple, in a different scenario, at a different time, with a different story going on around them, it would have been a sexy good time had by all. Bell writes sizzling fun sex scenes. There were just way too many things that made that scene inappropriate for this book. When I combine that with the anemic plot development and disjointed pacing of the narrative, the potential of the book went unrealized and I ended up not caring for it. I liked the characters very much...but unfortunately it wasn't quite enough.Reviewed for One Good Book Deserves Another.",0

Instead, the story features the standard cast of cast wilting women, muscle men, over-endowed aliens who lack a wardrobe and corpses.

1541,1,"Ugh. Bad. Terrible. Embarrassing. Offensive.I could have stopped my review there, but there is so much shade to be thrown right now.Here is the entire summary of the incredibly thin plot: College athletes Maverick and Duke are in love but they will never admit it because THEY ARE NOT GAY.THEY ARE NOT GAY.NO GAY HERE.NOPE.WE ARE STRAIGHT.WE LIKE THE LADIES.But...if you want to, we can sleep in the same bed and cuddle. Or hold hands. Or make out. We love and care about each other BUT ONLY AS FRIENDS. So let's spend literally an entire novella playing Gay Chicken, because that makes so much sense.This story just made no sense. It was actually embarrassing to read because these two guys acted so disgusted by each other until they were literally having sex. Every other sentence was just denial, denial, denial. ENOUGH ALREADY. This is not a PSA, this is a fluffy erotica novella. We do not want to read some dumb college kid's diatribes about how he looooooves the ladies so he CAN'T POSSIBLY BE GAY.This short, short story was SO trope-heavy, too. So many tropes in one tiny novella. We had Gay for Pay, Gay for You, Only Gay If I Take It Up the Butt, Doing it On a Dare, Camp Gay, Skin the Color of Food Racism, Big Gay Panic, Homophobe Bully, Homophobic Until Proven Gay...The list goes on and on.This story was a waste. It wasn't sexy. It was poorly written, insensitive, offensive, and oftentimes sexist, racist, and homophobic. It is written in a juvenile way with no narrative drive, no creative devices, and very little background info or subplot for either characters.I have so few standards when it comes to romance novels.  SO FEW.  And this still managed to disappoint.Skip this and read something better. It isn't worth the money.",0

For example, Ty will often tell us how Gwen was feeling rather than the author showing us through Gwen's actions and expressions. Typical beginning writer mistakes.

I was further turned off when she has sex in her office with Archer.  I love stories where the characters love each other, but I am not sure I see the romance in everybody having sex with everybody else.

About 85% of the book did nothing to set the scene, advance the plot, or give insight to the characters. They started off likable and interesting and just became more and more stupid and irritating. She wants a relationship with him, but does not want a relationship with a firefighter, but she likes him a lot, but she does not know, but she does want to be with him, but she is not sure about it, but she thinks they could be good together, but she just does not know......blah blah you get the idea. And that was just in one paragraph, which was repeated several times throughout the book. The author obviously did not do any research on fire departments, police departments, drugs, alcoholism or illegal gambling. It sounds like it was written by someone in high school. The plot could have made a great book, but it was ruined by absurdities and errors throughout. Definitely a waste of time. I feel like I need to apologize for being so mean, but it really was that bad. I dont know how anyone could give it 5 stars.",0
1554,2,"I gave this two stars because the writing was very good.  The problem was with the story, which I would give a one star.  I found it boring, so I quit after about two-thirds through.  the romance wasn't interesting, or believable.  There wasn't anything to like about the main characters -- I didn't dislike them, they were just people who, in my opinion, I didn't know well enough to care.I won't repeat what other reviews have written about the story -- so I recommend you read the 5 star reviews before you decide.",0
1555,2,"I downloaded this book to read to my five year old niece, but I hesitated to read certain parts of this story to her. Mercifully, she fell asleep before I got to those parts and just failed to notice.In a nutshell, there are a few parts of this story that are rather gruesome and I'd advise parents to read this book before they allow their children to.",0
1556,1,"I tried to get into this and just couldn't read it.  After several chapters, I finally gave up.  I think there's a story, but it sermed more like a published journal.",0
1557,2,"This book needs serious editing. There is too much repetition and misuse of words. (Cohorts instead of cahoots, for example. And per say? Really?) I also felt the writer does not have a good understanding of the age group she is working with. Fifty-three year olds are not as decrepit as she makes them out to be and not likely to be wearing french-twist hairdos. The villains were a bit too stupid to be believed. Background information is presented in such a circuitous way, the reader has no idea what the point was. Aggie moved from England to Palm Springs to be with her daughter. No. wait, she moved with her friend Betty because of Betty's cousin. Betty's cousin and Aggie's daughter both happen to be in the same place. Aggie moved and bought Betty a condo (so she would move, too?) The writer needs to figure this out, write it down and refer to it from time to time.",0
1558,1,"Okay so this book literally goes one paragraph in the present, then a flashback, present for a bit, flashback. It was so annoying. I felt so disconnected to the characters. I ended up rushing through because it was so annoying. I would not recommend this book. The hero constantly says he just feels lust for his WIFE. He talks about how he cannot let himself feels anything else. It is your WIFE, you are MARRIED, you can feel love for your wife you stupid anti-hero!!!! It was so aggravating. Then she walks out and he does not come after her but one word and a crook of the finger and there she goes running to him. It was just a pathetic excuse for a book and really, writing in general.",0
1559,2,"This book has a rather farfetched, but interesting premise...that a group of West Pointers going back over a hundred years are secretly controlling the world.  Could have been fun, but the author seems to have strung together a number of separately written sections, while forgetting what happened in the previous sections!  Its nuts, i.e. characters show up injured but no injury was ever described, characters jump from one location to another with no connection, and there seems to be no point to any of it.Very poor writing, even worse editing (does this author even have an editor?).  Mayer needs to clean up his writing, and get it edited.  In addition, his plot is rather thin, and if he's going to go for the outlandish, at least make it a little believable.But my biggest complaint about the book is that it isn't even exciting or particularly interesting. This is no thriller, in fact it drags along so slowly, and fails to grip the reader to such a degree it is actually quite boring and laborious to plod through.Update: After reading the book, the ending was fairly good and some action sequences just prior to the ending were't so bad. So, I'm upgrading the book from one star and making it two stars.  All of my previous comments stand, and Mayer will hopefully turn out something better next time.",0
1560,1,Ok until the nasty secret was revealed. Didnt expect that. will not be ready the sequels. My stomach can't take it.,0
1561,2,The author writes very well.  The story is short but captivating.  I really wish the story was a lot longer.  The storyline has such potential,0
1562,2,This one made me mad. I thought I was getting a whole book. I started to get interested in it and it ended. It came out as a teaser that didn't set well with me. I'd like to read the whole book.,0
1563,2,"Not a bad book, hooked me right off the bat, but the characters weren't developed.I felt like if I was in third grade I would have been completely captivated.

1565,1,Cardboard characters. Not worth wasting time on.Amazon required extra words so I can submit the review and read something good.,0
1566,2,"I've stopped short of giving this a one-star review because I can see that a lot of effort went into writing this book, and it's obviously a cut above some of the junk that finds its way into the Kindle marketplace, BUT...Why isn't it formatted it correctly?I was so looking forward to reading this. In fact, I still AM looking forward to reading this, if and when the author releases it in readable form. Unfortunately, when I went to open it, all I could see is page after page of text with NO paragraph indents... which makes this far too hard on the eyes to bother with. The only bright spot in this scenario is the fact that I downloaded this as a freebie, so I am spared the inconvenience of trying to return it for a refund.We've all been to school. We all know how fiction is supposed to be formatted. Even someone who has suffered a temporary bout of insanity and forgotten can simply pull a book down off the shelf and see at a glance that paragraph indents are a MUST. However talented the author of this book may be in other respects, she should know better than release a book without them.",0
1567,1,this was hands down the worse book i have ever read and trst me that says alot,0
1568,2,"I am afraid that this book did not grab me at all.  I didnt relate to the characters, and was surprised that there really was no depth to this tale.  I would not recommend it.",0
1569,1,"The blurb talks about secrets being revealed by a guardian.  I read to 93%, then skimmed the rest.  At 93%, there were still no secrets revealed.  This was a bunch of disjointed snippets put together.  Sometimes the pieces made sense and sometimes they didn't.  I'm still trying to figure out what this book was.  It wasn't terrible, it was just pointless.  Though Anna felt passion of various kinds, I never felt them with her.  The words were just words, words that didn't convey any real meaning to me as the reader.  She was in love with somebody, but I never understood why or really anything about her.  I never cared about her or her well-being.Grammar and spelling were good.  Book was well-edited.I'm not sorry to have skimmed the remaining 7% of the book, and I have zero interest in any other books by this author.  Your mileage may vary.",0
1570,1,"Very short story, glad it was free.  I didn't like the ending, it just stopped in the middle of the story and really didn't fit.  It seemed it was more for shock value rather than really contributing to the story. Won't buy the rest of this series.",0
1571,1,"A big thumbs-down to Smithsonian Magazine's decision to automatically remove the previous month's edition as soon as the new one arrives on your Kindle. If I don't manage to get the current edition read on time, they take away the product that I paid for.  Bad marketing decision and I'll be cancelling my subscription because of this.  I'd consider buying the magazine hard-copy edition, but the whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  National Geographic is more deserving of my money and I don't feel cheated by them.",0
1572,2,"The good: I was beginning to like this story. The characters were pretty strong, the plot was intriguing. I liked them together, loved her having to be a maid.The bad: Parts of the book were ridiculous. The families knew each other, they met as children, their mothers were best friends......but they didnt know she was a red head  and not a pale blonde? The author dragged parts of the book out and then decided to end it abruptly, skipping over the details and throwing everything into a few pages. No concrete happy ending, no punishment for one of the main villains, just a glossed over recap of the hero's actions told to us.Overall: Could have been a great book. I got this for free, but was still disappointed. The author blew the ending, blew the last chapter.",0
1573,1,"I think the writer has talent, and the premise of this story sounded promising, but I started skimming before I even reached the halfway point.  The male main character was likeable, but the female main character was not. At all.  She was abrupt and abrasive and used one bad relationship as an excuse to be rude at every turn, to a very nice person.  Time for her to grow up - her attitude ruined the whole story for me.  I won't be continuing on with this series.",0
1574,1,This book was very slow in getting to the story. The storyline jumped from scene to scene. The main character was weak and in denial the entire time about her powers. Most of the story she was placing her friends in danger because she was too stupid to do what had to be done to save everyone. Every scene someone had to rescue her from herself and others.,0
1575,1,"I'm sure the author feels quite edgy having taken the underexplored theme of vampires and adding a bunch of Justin Bieber jokes.  I mean, who thinks to joke about Justin Bieber?  This book is so unfunny it is almost intolerable.Just when you think it can't get any worse, she turns her keen sense of humor to werewolves and poop jokes.Jones, we get it.  You readTwilight (The Twilight Saga, Book 1).  But did you not realize that every single one of these jokes has been made before?",0

Waste of time if you borrow it.",0

1579,1,"First off I understand this was supposed to be a short story so I shouldn't have expected too much but, if you give your main character a background that involves her family being murdered by a vampire, you don't have the main character jump into bed with a vampire as soon as she can. That's unrealistic. If this was a story with only humans, that would be like saying the man she became involved with is related to the killer who murdered her brother. You can't tell me she's not going to have some pent up anger and that her lust is going to make her forget all about her grief. Like I said unrealistic.",0
1580,1,"I chose this rating because I hated it. I hated it because it was harfd to read, it was on kindle, and I couldn't slip a bookmark between the pages.",0
1581,2,"First and foremost, I'd just like to point out that this is actually a good book but ultimately the open-relationship Zach allowed Angelo to have killed my enjoyment of the story. I'm not saying I judge their relationship, I just don't understand it and I don't want to read about it. If you like reading about all that and if you don't mind open-relationships, that's cool, but I prefer monogamous relationships over anything else and that's that. :-/It was great getting another installment of the guys, though. In the past, Angelo was my favorite character but, unfortunately, he's not anymore. He's actually my least favorite now and Matt is firmly at the top. Anyways, I liked the fact that we got to see Matt get a little more intimate with Jared in public (there's only a brief scene but still, it was sweet) and I liked the fact that Zach and Angelo get closer through their little 'kink'. It was nice how everything worked out in the end even if it wasn't the way I'd like it to have ended.I will say that I thought Angelo was a freaking hypocrite the way Zach let him fool around with other guys but he wouldn't let Zach do the same. And I also thought it was way out of character for Angelo to do that since in A to Z he was pretty gaga over Zach and didn't give any indication that he'd do something like that but that's just my opinion. At the beginning, I thought Angelo was walking all over Zach but it's clear by the end that Zach actually gets turned on by Angelo dancing with other guys and knowing that by the end of the day, Angelo will always be his. Still don't understand it but all power to them, right?I liked seeing pieces of Angelo's old personality and how he could pretty much lose anyone with how he just goes off topic and then back on it again. There was also brief spurts of humor I rather enjoyed and I especially enjoyed getting back into Matt's head again.All in all, I think this would have been a great book if the whole conflict of Zach and Angelo's sexual life would have been left out but that's just my opinion and because of that, I can't recommend this book. Sorry :-/",0
1582,2,From the first chapter I couldn't get into the story or characters very disappointing from the review I read. Anymore I won't waste time on a poor book which this truly. The characters are unlikeable & for me that just kills a book.,0
1583,2,"I have read other books by this author and I had great expectations for this book that were not met.  I was very disappointed. I was expecting a deep romance with a perceptive, empathic hero and a heroine who had been royally screwed by her fiance and sister.  This book was just rushed and weird.  It was like the author was in a hurry and left out details and wanted to throw way too much into this short book.First, there were alot of things just thrown in and blown over.  I cannot recall if I read what the heroine does for a living.  Also, there was alot of drama surrounding the sister running off with the fiance on the wedding day but there were no details given about the sisters' relationship before the incident.  There is the mention of a few other visitors and employees at the dude ranch but they are all glossed over. There is another man interested in thd heroine briefly.  He is given about 2 pages.  There is very little character development and I did not care about any of these people.  Even the sex scenes were skimpy and rushed.When the heroine goes to the ranch, there is a little drama with another woman who is chasing the hero but even this was confusing.  It was really not necessary to the story and the drama was not fully developed.  Just thrown in here and there almost like an after thought.Also, the heroine spends the first part of the book disliking the hero just because he was handsome and she was attracted to him, I think.  Not really sure why.  He spends all his time telling her he knows she does not like him.  That is the extent of his perceptive empath abilities.The secret is frankly, stupid.  I won't give it away but I guessed it pretty early.  I was hoping I was wrong because it really did not fit in with the story.  When it finally came out, even the reveal was less than satisfactory.  I cannot say more without spoiling this.The interracial aspect of this novel was non-existent.  There was a BRIEF mention of race and that was all.  These people could have been blue for all race mattered.The ending was a complete rushed cop out.  It really felt like the author realized ""oh yeah, I need to write a last chapter"" so she did so without any real buildup.  If you cared about the characters (which I did not), you would feel cheated by how fast their ""conflict"" was resolved and how.Two stars because this author has done better and she did make the effort to write this book.  The story has a good premise and a good start.  It just fell flat.",0
1584,1,"Had they given me an opportunity to give this book MINUS stars, I would have done so. I enjoy racy books that have a story-line that details the romp. However, this book...this pollution...wallows well below the level of depravity. As I read it, I felt I was reading on the edge of a serial crime mind...you know..., when you put the book aside and stare into the distance and are amazed that it even exists and you get that sour bile taste in your mouth that says: This is beyond...garbage.",0
1585,2,Same old same old.  Nothing new or interesting in this erotic story.  It was also very short.  I really don't recommend this book.,0
1586,1,This is the most ridiculous book I have ever read.  I really don't know why I finished it.  I hope no one else wastes their money.,0
1587,1,i read two pages of this book and couldnt read any more. i didnt get what the author was trying say at all. the language used was horrendous. try a sample first. if you like the first two pages this one is probably for you,0
1588,2,"I downloaded this after I read ""Veiled Eyes"" which I thought was pretty good. Obviously this is one of her early works. The first few pages read like a story outline. The author tries to cram tons of backstory into a few paragraphs, which is unsatisfying to a reader. I'd much rather the story unfold as I read rather than be told the cliff notes version up front. And then there's the so-called romance. It basically is along the lines of, ""we're both gorgeous, so Tab A must fit into Slot B"". No build-up or getting to know the characters before they're getting it on because they're passionately in something. Right after he just saved her from dying because of bodily injury. I don't care how much magic's involved, you don't get up from your deathbed to roll in the hay, especially if you think the bad guys might still be on your trail. On top of that add really unique (not in a good way) descriptive words and phrases. At least it was short. The other two stories which follow are actually much better, so if you like paranormal romance that involves people who are tall, dark and furry I would go ahead and read it. But literature it ain't.",0
1589,2,So basically this book is about a girl whose in to baseball players. She's with 4 of them throughout the whole book then suddenly picks one of the guys within the last 4 pages of the book.,0

1592,2,"If this was a short story to draw the reader into the series - it FAILED big time.Nissa goes to a Vampire club because she wants sex with a vampire and to ultimately become a Vampire herself - (maybe because she is lonely, not really explained).  The author tells you that Nissa is drawn to the club and to Hex & Aleron.  The reader is then told after days of having sex in every way possible in a menage that love now exists.  At that point - all I could do was think - well, that's nice - didn't ever feel the love but whatever.I like stories with a high ""heat"" factor but I also want well-developed plots with interesting characters and interactions.In this novella:- Dialogue was flat- Characters one dimensional- No originality- The plot is ????? - not sure if there is one- Sex scenes read more like a ""how to"" book than an erotic scene- Rushed HEA - they had sex and then the reader is told that they are in love - didn't really feel itThe short story was mostly pages after pages of the three having sex but I would describe it as just graphic rather than erotic and definitely not sizzling.  If you want a very short ""how to"" book on a few of the different ways to have sex - then this book is for you.  Not very imaginative but it does contain some of the standard ways found in countless of erotica books that are more original and better developed.",0
1593,1,I could not get into any part of this book. It was so unbelievable it was a waste of my time to read it.,0
1594,2,"This is a crap novel.Not because the plot is bad...it isn't.And not because the characters are thin...they aren't.No, this is a crap novel because it is page after page of grammar error, spelling error, inconsistency and sheer idiocy.And that's a real shame, because as withInto the Black: Odyssey One [Remastered Edition], there is a good story drowned in what is a hack piece of writing.Basically, Currie writes with no apparent care or precision, and ""Thermals"" will frustrate any reader who cares about such things. Indeed, it is not exaggeration to say that there is a grammar and/or spelling error every couple of pages.For a few examples of the inconsistencies, consider an Interpol Inspector, our leading character Anselm Gunnar. He's European but when we meet him he's thinking in Imperial units, not metric. That's about as likely as Alicia Keys belting out `God Save the Queen' as the National Anthem at the Super Bowl.He switches to metric in short order (in fact the whole novel switches to metric), but that kind of gaff is typical of the errors embedded in ""Thermals"".Or an emergency call being dialled as `9-1-1' when such a call would be `0-0-0' in Australia.Or a `START' team (some kind of fast response military team) becoming a `STRT' team half way through the novel. I guess the `A' in the acronym was not really needed after all?We also see a police car cruising a desert road at just under 400 km/h (and screaming around town at 200 km/h). I've seen Top Gear's James May doing his Bugatti Veyron Top Speed Test and you don't steer a car going that fast ""around a snake in the road"". Whether that's actually a slinky, slimy snake or just a description of a corner, the believability factor was zero for me.And the massive structure at the heart of the novel, the Australian `Tower of Power', is introduced as Gunner flies in as ""both five thousand feet below them and also loomed another twenty thousand feet above.""Exactly what those twenty thousand feet refer to remained a mystery to me as the tower itself is only a kilometre high, or just over 3,000 feet.And from that tower it was possible to see the skyscrapers of distant Sydney. But the Tower of Power is apparently in the midst of the Outback, so the distances just don't make sense. In fact, most of the distances don't make much sense and I doubt Currie has visited the Outback because a road train won't get to Sydney in a `few hours'. Given the vastness of Australia, even a jet has trouble doing that!OK, it's only a novel, but right across the board, Currie takes a reasonable plot and fleshed out characters - even the evil terrorist was well drawn and quite interesting in his motives and actions - and applies a laissez-faire attitude to how he actually writes it.So, I'm recommending this for teenage readers. It's the type of novel I would have devoured as a fifteen year old, not noticing or caring about the inconsistencies...though even then I still would have found the grammar and spelling errors a pain.",0

1596,2,"I truly think I understand what the author wanted to do with this book.  Kudos for that.Reading it was work.  What's real - oh that wasn't.  wait.  That was real.  True you have to be on the last page to realize it but, for myself, I missed the significance of the 'two planes' by not being aware that that's where it mattered.Had I been 'in like' with the book I might have done a do over but by the end it was: a. do over? b. beat me, spank me, make me write hot checks! c. none of the above",0
1597,2,"I love inspiring Christmas stories.  This one wasn't very inspiring in my opinion.I couldn't begin to relate to the main character.  While everyone makes mistakes, this guy's life was one bad choice after another.  Then, instead of learning from those mistakes, he seemed to want to blame others for his situation--he hadn't paid his rent, but it was his landlord's fault that he was evicted; he couldn't get public assistance, but it was the government employee's fault because he hadn't filed for help within the required time period; he inquired about a job at an establishment that he'd been begging near, was dirty and poorly dressed when he did so, but it was the manager's fault he didn't get the job; his daughter fell while he was supposedly watching her and injured herself so severely that she required surgery, but it was the surgeon's fault she ended up in a coma.The book also had noticeable grammatical errors--missing commas and missing words were common.  The lack of contractions also made the narration seem stiff.To top it all off, the story just sort of...stops.  The author makes some comments in his afterword, but, still, many loose ends were left dangling.I would never tell someone not to read a book.  These statements are merely my opinion.  It's a short, quick read, and it has a bargain price.",0
1598,1,"Vampires, in the post-""Twilight"" world, have become a real mix-and-match type of character for authors.  If you don't like certain characteristics associated with vampires, just make up new ones.  Have your vampires drink from animals, go outside (and sparkle), do whatever you feel.  What do you do, however, if even new style best-of-all-possible-characteristics vampires aren't special enough for you?  Enter the ""vampeen,"" a rather unfortunate name that sounds more like something that Edward might pull out of his pants during a moment of passion than the vampire-human hybrid this book introduces us to.Lexi is a ""regular"" teenage girl (""regular"" in that her socio-economic status is way beyond that of the average teenager) who, Twilight-style, notices a mysterious but cute classmate.  He turns out to know her family and quickly lets her know that her life is about to change forever.  She's a vampire-human hybrid and all the non-human parts of her genetic code will turn on exactly at midnight on her sixteenth birthday, which - conveniently - is just a week away.  Apparently her parents thought the less time she had to deal with this the better (they also felt like it was better for a near-total stranger to help guide her through this transition).  They're really the ciphers in the book - they don't much guide her or help her at all.  Their function is to fund all her activities and discourage her from having sex.  I would figure that any person who is literally hunting humans can make her own decision about sex, but this book has the same weird anti-sex vibe that permeates the ""Twilight"" series.As a ""vampeen,"" Lexi is immortal and will gain superhuman strength and speed.  She will also lose all the extra weight that has been plaguing her and will be a perfect size four (and be beautiful).  However, vampires hate vampeens (there's a whole clunky backstory) and she is advised to maintain a low profile so that she doesn't draw the attention of the vampire hunter.  Instead she decides to throw a huge, over-the-top sweet sixteen party to debut her new size four figure in front of all the classmates who were mean to her (literally - she had two friends before her transformation).Reading this book is like getting a lengthy tour of the author's personal wish fulfillment fantasies.  She wakes up amazingly beautiful, has two cute guys fighting over her, has an aunt to take her on a shopping spree where they spend tens of thousands of dollars, gets a Mercedes, is super-powerful, has rare ""vampeen"" abilities (weirdly, the ability is ""will power""), has a perfect body, experiences an amazing love connection with a cute vampire, and becomes immortal.  I finally hit my limit when it was revealed to her that she was the one foretold in ""vampeen"" (I'm sorry - I refuse to take the word seriously) prophecy who will bring peace between the vampire and ""vampeen"" camps.  It's just too ridiculous.  At the end of the book, Lexi - out of pretty much nowhere - springs her unique theological theory on us.  Vampires and ""vampeens"" are actually God's chosen people.  Well, Lexi, I'm glad you cleared that up.  Pages and pages of how beautiful she thinks she is now, how awesome her Juicy Couture sweats are, how great her stuff is . . . it's vacant materialistic junk.The story would be enough to justify the low star rating, but the writing is what really pushes it over the top.  I thought for the first few chapters that the author had used a word processor thesaurus program to replace ""regular"" words with fancier words, giving the book an awkward feel - but then I began running into misuses that I know even a computer wouldn't suggest.  Things like ""the iPod engulfed his bicep"" (that sounds like a horrible technical malfunction), ""no indecent exposure was placating before you"" (huh?), and ""I really wish I could have captured the pure divulgence her eyes depicted.""  Those are just three misused words out of dozens.  Even when words are technically correct, the effect is so bizarre.  One character will ask another a question and the response will be several pages of stilted and floral language, an inept baroque stew of words and then other character will then respond with something like ""O.M.G!"".  ""?!"" is regularly used as a punctuation mark.  The writing is just . . . not good.",0
1599,2,"I enjoyed the first 1/3 of this book.  The story was engaging and I am always hopeful that I'll find a really great thriller in the same vein as Tom Clancy. (a person can dream, can't they?)I was especially pleased when an early scenario came to a satisfying, timely resolution.  I looked forward to enjoying the rest of a fast paced read.Sadly, this wasn't meant to be.  The last 2/3 of the book could have been told in half the time.  The story started to drag and meander.  The reader can see where the book is going, but it takes such a long, round-about way to get there that I found myself skimming trying to get to the inevitable conclusion.Two other negative points were: 1) It was difficult to get in the government's corner over the root issue.  Without giving anything away, I could definitely see the terrorist's point when it came to their outrage against the U.S.2) The suspense of this book took a hit when it became apparent that the only truly 'together' group in this tale was the mafia portion.  Neither the government agencies nor the terrorist group were very bright or formidable.  Some of the passages were truly cringe worthy.A HUGE turn off for me was the inclusion of a romantic twist.  I absolutely HATE that.  I would love to find a well written mystery/ thriller that does not pander to the unnecessary tendency to include a love story.To me, nothing weakens a thriller like having some soppy mess thrown in just to satisfy...what?  I don't even know.  It's completely ridiculous.  In this tale you have agents navigating the woods in search of a terrorist stronghold.  These are supposedly the 'best of the best' and the situation is of dire national importance.  So what does the author do?  He throws in romantic schlock so that two of the agents can become distracted and waste the reader's time with idiotic inner musings.  The middle of a life and death situation is not the time for that crap.  It's a cheap device and I abhor authors who employ it.Along that same vein, I quickly became tired of the protagonist's wife whining about his job and its effect on their marriage.  She knew it going in, but takes every opportunity to make him feel guilty...even in the midst of a terrible national crisis.Perhaps the subsequent books in this series are better.  This one, however, seems disjointed and covers too much ground to be plausible or enjoyable.I would hesitate to read another book in this series because this one was so difficult to slog through until the end.",0
1600,2,I tried to like this story but it was just ok for me.  I could not connect with the characters.  It fell short of a romance to me.  It didn't leave me thinking about the story or characters after I read it.,0
1601,2,Unfortunately I lost interest in this book and ended up leaving it in the middle.  I guess I have been too spoiled with certain very seasoned writers and found the writing style and story line lacking a bit.,0
1602,2,"This book is a f-m-m-m-m, there is a LOT of implausibiity in the set up and circumstance.  The sex scenes are plentiful for such a short book, but there was no emotional connection between the woman and the men.  It concluded almost unbelievably.  There are better books out there.",0
1603,2,"This is one of those times where I wish we could score 1/2 stars, I would give 1 1/2 here.The author really tried, and as someone who has been trying to finish his own murder mystery, I applaud him for his work.However, the writing was so clumsy and awkward.I felt like I was reading a letter (and a poorly written one at that).  ""He said....and then she said....and I told them.""Show, don't tell - the primary rule of fiction writing - is what's missing here.  I feel like I was told a story and not shown one.The characters all have potential, but I did not feel like I got to know them because the clunky first person narrative (which switched to third a few times without warning) did not flesh them out.I love a good murder mystery series, but sadly, I can't bring myself to read anything more in this series.As for the mystery itself, the author pretty much handed the killer over to the reader without a lot of suspense.  No red herrings, nothing that made me second guess myself.  There was an interesting twist at the end, which I did enjoy.I love ebooks because they give everyone a chance to have their stories heard and I appreciate the effort, but this just did not work for me.",0

1606,2,"""His Voice, His Command"" is pretty apt-- the guy spends most of this erotic short story flapping his jaw instead of actually doing anything.  Also, while I'm not one to demand elaborate backstory for my porn, I spent most of the story with absolutely no idea where this dude and this lady were, why she was submitting to him, and whether it was consensual, which does affect what I find hot and what I don't.  The revelation of all that at the end was decent and resolved some of the feminist issues I'd been having with the story (though not all of them), but... yeah, too much jaw-flappin' about ""take off your high heels, career lady, you exist only for my pleasure"" for my personal tastes.Also, you know what's not hot?  When a woman yells ""Oh god, kill me!"" during sex.(No, I'm not kidding, she actually says ""Kill me.""  If I were the guy, I would not feel flattered.)",0

The book spiraled out of control pretty much immediately, leaving me wishing I never read it.

All 3 women (a mother and her 2 daughters) are nuts.  When I finished it, I felt very dirty and needed a shower.  Not sexy at all, there is sex, but it's gross weird sex.",0

1610,2,"I will admit I LOVED the plot behind this book.  I even laughed out loud at one point.  I can't remember the last time I read a romance novel and laughed.  That being said, I'm not actually a fan of tons and tons of humor in a romance novel, this author however, wrote nicely and I fancied the change from my normal choices.  This is sort of where it goes downhill for me; I would have loved more 'heat,' between the hero and heroine.  A little more build-up to the sex.  I feel like the whole book went a bit monotone after the first few chapters and I was disappointed.",0
1611,1,"I was really enjoying the story until suddenly the human girls are not human at all. This shift happened so suddenly that I really felt the author got to a dead end, didnt know where to go, so she made the girls non-humans to wrap it up. Maybe if the witch at the beginning had given as speach welcoming everyone and warning them that life as they know it was about to drastically change; their beliefs about themselves and their very nature, would never be the same... At least I would know that the story was not just slapped together. I would actually be trying to figure out what was going to change. I will not be continuing with this series.",0

1613,1,"Yes, I understand that the book is about food addiction, obesity, and the consequences. The author just didn't make me care. There was not one character who moved me. All I could think was, ugh, when will this be over? It was like slogging through quicksand.",0
1614,2,"Nice message, The story is about bad mannered child. The rhymes and meter is out. But the story is good and it moves along well with Henry taking advice and solving his problem in the end. The art could have been better. The grandkids sat through it and asked for a reread.",0

1619,2,"I feel like I should have given this novel more of a chance but I genuinely just cannot get past the horrible grammar. The author has endless amounts of run-on sentences, some of which are worded oddly. I feel like it could have been a good novel, but the premise doesn't interest me enough to try and work through the bad writing.",0
1620,1,"At first I was sort of amused, because I figured this was the kind of book Barbara Cartland might write, if she wrote gay romance, sex scenes and omitted the ellipses. Then I realized just how unfair I was being to Barbara.The one hero, Will, is plucky, virtuous, and has the IQ of a turnip. As he is weaker financially and in a precarious situation, he is naturally also smaller in build and the bottom. The other hero is... well, I'm not quite sure what he is. Of course, he's tall, dark, muscular, strong, opinionated, unapologetically gay in a butch way, and a total top. I'm not sure if his name is Elijah or Eli (and yes, I know one is a shortened form of the other, but generally one picks one or the other form, and doesn't switch between them about fifteen times in a single scene). He  falls in love with Will over a phone call - as any man in his mid-thirties would, especially if he thinks he's talking to a gold-digger - and schemes to get him to Montana. Then, when Will arrives, Eli(jah) is tender, loving and slobbering all over Will one moment and stand-offish and angry the next. He's also stalkerish, and announces to all and sundry that he will marry Will before he's really proposed to Will, but apparently this is a sign of grand passion and taking charge in a manly won't-take-no-for-an-answer sort of way, rather than of being a bit unhinged and totally creepy.Mr. Stretke, even romance has to contain at least some concept of reality; I'm not sure you could have gotten away with the story you're trying to tell here if you had trasported the couple into Regency England and turned Will into the eighteen-year old daughter of an impoverished country cleric. (Also,just a small tip: if a character is alone and you suddenly enclose one of his sentences in quotation marks, most readers can figure out that he said something and that he did so out loud. You don't have to spell it out for us every single time it happens. Which is way too often.)",0
1621,2,"I enjoy BDSM books and I realize everyone has their own opinions. This one is mine.I tried. I tried very hard to get into the story, but man it was impossible to ignore the stilted dialogue and what seemed to me almost moronic logic in the characters.

1623,2,"It took me awhile to get into the book. Slow moving at first, more interesting towards the end of the book.",0
1624,1,"...because once in a while, one might be fantastic. This one, sadly, was not.I found the entire concept unbelievably distasteful. We have a mega-rich man, twelve years older than the heroine, who basically grooms her from when she was 16 years old to be his future wife. Together with her brother they ensure she does not really date, threaten away or buy off any man that might be interested in her and keep her mostly secluded. The entire concept feels almost - and I say almost!! - like dirty old men grooming little innocent girls for illegal sexual relations. I don't want to use harsher language here, but I was disgusted by the whole book.Then, we have a doctor in a hospital providing the heroine's brother with her health information before even thinking of talking to the heroine. Federal health privacy legislation (HIPAA) anyone??? It just keeps getting worse.Next, there are the unbelievably annoying spelling mistakes. Ms Wards, the correct spelling of the alternative word for 'also' is 'too' - not 'to'. Furthermore, it is 'platonic', not 'plutonic'. Pluto the planet, Pluto the dog, Pluto the ancient god have nothing whatsoever to do with this word. Get an editor - your writing is bad, very bad.",0
1625,1,This book was beyond depressing. The author doesn't think much of our future. I actually felt sick when I finished it. A little to hopeless and dark for me. Now I'm going to go throw up...,0
1626,1,"I've enjoyed everything Rain has had a hand in writing except this. None of the characters felt real or even interesting. For such a short story, the boring bits seemed to go on forever and just when touching on something intriguing, the authors skimmed away to drivel again.",0

1630,2,"After reading this novel I still have mixed thoughts on how to label it. I went through the usual list: is it a tale of suspense, a thriller, a medical mystery, a psychological drama, a simple fiction or a combination of all of the above? Don't mistake me it was a fair read although at times hard to grasp but what intrigued me the most was its premise. As I carried on I became quite curious by the life of the many characters, many lived a very shallow life style. I was captivated by the things they did for money and their outrageous behaviour in their quest for romance and love.The story centers on Simon Patterson, a dedicated neurosurgeon at a local hospital and at home an obsessed researcher looking for eternal youth in his spare time. His research takes his attention away from his wife who complains about their dull life, his neglect towards her and his spending habits regarding his experiments. The household finances are a continual source of friction until the day he saved the life of a powerful mobster Carlo Vucci..... This is the start of a turning point in their life.In gratitude, the Pattersons are invited for dinner at Carlo Vucci's residence and when he introduces his wife, the beautiful Christine, to the doctor there is instant chemistry. A few weeks later when Christine shows up at the hospital faking terrible headaches, the doctor is all too willing to help her. Meeting her outside the possessive eyes of Vucci proves to be the start of a downhill spiral for the doctor, a nightmare that eventually opens the doors to multiple murders.....We start with one chapter after another with events that at first seem like unrelated stories however when the catalyst kicks in, the doctor surfaces as the main character. At this point, the story becomes interesting and starts to gel but eventually it became so predictable that I started to lose interest once again. The plot has many characters, some are rather stiff and others are so nave, stereotypical and immensely frustrating, they became a turn off. In my opinion, the main characters had a lackluster appeal at times and the secondary characters were a little overdone. A good part of the novel moves at a snail pace but to be fair to the author there are some interesting twists and turns along the way. Sorry Mr. Fox ""Promise Me Eternity"" is not one of my favourites....",0
1631,1,"I discovered, after downloading it that it only contained one month. Considering you would have to keep purchasing it every month it would get expensive  I deleted it..",0
1632,1,I just couldn't do it. This book was just too boring for me. I couldn't get past the first couple chapters.,0
1633,2,Unexplained temper tantrums from shallow characters make for a fluffy uninteresting read.  It feels underdeveloped (especially the first half) and never really made me care about the characters.,0
1634,2,I found it hard to read this book. Maybe because it took a long time before it finally got to the main characters getting together? I skipped a lot in this book because the beginning really didn't grab hold of my attention nor interest.,0
1635,2,"As I began reading this book, I was drawn to the plight of Anna.  Anna is a fifteen year old girl who suffers from epilepsy.  She is unable to live a normal life due to the severity of her seizures.  Unfortunately, as I continued reading, a feeling of undeveloped characters distracted me from Anna's situation.  Her family members are not realistically described, nor were other characters in the story.  The killer in the story was a disappointment, as it seemed his thoughts and action were not given enough attention by the author.  It almost felt like the writer didn't want to delve too deeply into her characters, which caused me to be unable to develop any feelings about them.  I felt that the description of the surgery to separate the two halves of Anna's brain was descriptive and it is obvious the author did her research.  However, although the story line was fast paced, the situations were not transitioned into well.  The love interest between (nope, won't spoil it) seemed to be added on to the story as an afterthought.  I received a free copy of this book so I could review it.  I would not recommend it to other readers who enjoy getting drawn into a book and becoming emeshed in the characters and story line.",0
1636,2,"Lots of action which bolsters a tired plot of terrorists' efforts to attack the U.S.  Mediocre character development and too much reliance on James Bond gadgets to have enough realism to present the reader with a credible story, especially during the final one-third or so of the story.  For readers who are science fiction fans this story might be enjoyable; others probably will become a little bored, as the very predictable conclusion becomes obvious around the mid-point.  I do think the author has potential and hopefully his future efforts will more realistic.",0

I found it hard to follow as it was part of a series, and there wasn't enough detail in the first chapter to give you a lot of groundwork - it seemed to assume you've read the previous books. By the time I quit reading, things were really just... not very believable. Not plausible at all, for a woman with an abusive former husband.",0

(You don't want things visually complicated.)This might give some parents something to associate with each letter as they teach their children, but it's not a book I think will work otherwise.Don't recommend.",0

The writing looks like it was done by a teenager, sentence structure so bad and terrible dialogue.  I only read the beginning because it was so bad I couldn't read anymore. I love books about people moving to other countries, but this was awful.  The author apparently was from England, not the US, so her language is a bit different, but that didn't account for the poor sentences.  Don't waste your time.",0
1641,2,"Ok so........Preston has one of the coldest attitudes towards his wife Delight and for the life of me, I cannot fathom how she deserves such harsh treatment from him after all he is the one that stepped outside of their marriage not her (although she definitely played a large role in his need to seek comfort outside his marriage). I do believe Mr. Williams accurately displays how current society has no staying power in relationships. Instead of working through things, it's easier to toss it to the side and start anew with another. Which is exactly what Preston is doing and his conscience is working overtime trying to save him. He fails to acknowledge how his actions or lack thereof are affecting his current and unborn children. And to think, he is working his way through the ministry......oh no that is one church I would not be attending. This book much like the first, had poor editing and grammatical errors. Mr. Williams has a good story line, but needs more attention to detail and some fine tuning.",0
1642,1,"This is the worst book ever. This my first read by this author and I have to say it is baaad. I can understand teen angst but this book goes over board. Therefore the main character is constantly going back and forth about her boyfriends best friend. And the actual language of the book is truly that over a teenager. ""like, seriously? for reall? I mean really? so weird"" is the characters choice dialogue.Don't read this, there are better more substantial young adult reads out there!",0

The elf 'redeems' himself by saving Santa from a snowman with a karate kick to the snow man.  The disobeying and then running away plot is overused in a lot of self-published children's books.  The whole first part of the story about the toys being manufactured factory-style instead of hand-made by elves was dull to my grandkids.  Hard to get  them to make it to the end of the story.  I thought the karate kick to the snow man was ridiculous but it was funny to them and actually the only part of the book they responded to.",0
1644,1,"These three stories all feel long.  Really long.  They take forever to build up to their point and when you get there, they just aren't that scary.  Although the details varied, there was a dreary ""They were dead all along!"" sameness to them (not as if that is the literal end to each story, but really -- close enough).  There is a lack of fresh thinking or detail and a willingness to settle for the cliche (teenager who kills his family loves Jim Morrison - yawn).Three tales of ghostly tedium.",0

""You're always beautiful to me, my darling, and I don't mind if you weep for I shall comfort you in my warm muscular manly arms!""  Like that.  There's lots of sex, and even some language, but it's kind of forced-sounding in context, like this is the kind of lady who would normally say ""winky"" and ""hooha.""The dialogue is pretty awful-- ""I'd like to [blank] you until we're completely spent, Kayla"" is a fair sample-- and so is the narration (""As much as he wanted to continue, he also believed in respecting a woman's wishes"").Not one-star egregiously awful, but definitely not my thing.*Ew, that sounds really gross.",0

1647,2,I have enjoyed other books written by this author but this book wasn't up to par. The angst felt contrived and over-blown. I felt like screaming as the 'solution' to ensure their HEA was so freaking obvious. Aside from that there were some minor consistency issues (M wearing contacts one minute and his glasses falling off later in the same scene) which made me twitch with annoyance. I just couldn't enjoy this book at all. It felt too formulaic and I didn't feel the author's passion or interest. Disappointing.,0
1648,2,"The publisher's blurb gives a fairly good synopsis of the story, so I'm not going to waste time rehashing it.  The details are what sunk this book for me.Abby is, for lack of a better term, a hot mess.  She likes having sex with all sorts of people in all sorts of situations, yet she's worried about people thinking she's a slut (her direct quote).  She flips out at Eric when she thinks he's going to ask for a deeper commitment beyond the sex they've been having, but she doesn't have any issues at all in the span of a couple of days agreeing to be in a permanent menage relationship.I know this is more of a short story/novella, but the total lack of meaningful descriptons and character development is ridiculous.  All we know about Eric is that he's horny all the time; Jett is pretty much someone's wishful thinking - a male model who also happens to be brilliant and in his residency stage of medical school; Abby is in a state of unending PMS but she pretty much thinks anything or anybody having sex is ""hot.""  They all have the dimension of a piece of paper.I didn't find the erotic scenes at all interesting.  It was more like, ""tab A goes into tab B and tab C is either watching or thinking about what it should do next.""  Bleh.Kelly Jamieson is a decent author; I've read some of her other work, and this just doesn't do her any justice.  For anyone that might find it objectionable, there are M/M, M/F and M/M/F scenes.",0
1649,2,"I received this book in exchange for an honest review. No compensation was given, offered, or received.Before I get started, I'd just like to state that I did not finish Falls the Shadow. Falls the Shadow was a little difficult for me to really invest myself in. The premise and plot were actually very interesting, it just didn't really captivate me for some reason.As I understand it, all of the events in Falls the Shadow take place in Midgard after Ragnarok which is supposed to basically be the end of the world except for the fact that the earth is supposed to be repopulated afterward. Now that gods like Odin and Thor are dead, the power-hungry are searching for powerful artifacts/treasure the gods once used so they can awaken Loki.There are a number of main characters throughout the story but I honestly didn't connect with any of them. Lady Amena was interesting but that was about as far as my connection went. I don't know much about Norse mythology so I kind of felt a little lost sometimes. I appreciated how each of the characters' story lines lead up to one another. I think the execution was well done. Each characters' storyline wove neatly together. There was never any confusion as to who I was reading about.Unfortunately, I didn't particularly enjoy having to keep track of so many people and different story lines. Maybe it would have been easier if I knew the characters better. But, for me, it was difficult and made getting into the story harder. Of course, I'm not used to this type of writing either, so I might just be out of practice too.The writing itself was well done. It made me feel like I was in a different world or rather that I was reading about a world that wasn't my own. Honestly, I admire that in authors. Not everyone can do that.All in all, the premise was really interesting but, for whatever reason, I just wasn't captivated.",0

Not a bad story line, just a lot of repetitive actions throughout the book. Once the author stuck to a way to describe something that was all you read over and over.

1659,2,"~ 2 Zorn Stars ~Ral&#8217;s Woman is the first book in the sci-fi romance &#34;Zorn Warriors&#34; series. Well I&#8217;ve not read much sci-fi alien romance love stores, so I don&#8217;t have much to compare this too, though I have read other Laurann Dohner works and I must say Ral&#8217;s Woman was poorly done.Ral is a Zorn alien. Him and his people have been cavorted and in slaved by the lizard aliens to mine the astroid/ship. When he meets Ariel he is really curious about her and is eager to learn the ways of pleasing a woman of her species. He&#8217;s very partitive of Ariel: &#8220;She is mine. Don&#8217;t touch her. You touch her. You Die.&#8221;Ariel well first I thought of the little mermaid and had a good laugh, but moving on. Ariel is human and she has been kidnapped from Earth by lizard type aliens who want to breed her. As it turned out she is not compatible to breed with the lizard guys, so instead they give her to the Zorn who they have in slaved to mine their astroid/ship. The Zorn must fight and the winner gets her. Ral wins and takes her to his room caveman style where they have hot sex. Then he starts saying that she is his. &#8220;I think you don not understand. You are mine for life. I claim you. I won you. I will keep you. We will breed often and I am hoping you will take my seed to root.&#8221;It&#8217;s a very simple read, short, not very well done, and predictable. Not much world creation, but maybe in the other books it comes out. The description of sex scenes was poor, character development is nell, and I never felt a connection between Ariel and Ral. Maybe it was supposed to happen when they locked eyes at first meeting, but I felt nothing and as the book progressed I still did not feel that love connection even when they mentioned love.",0
1660,2,"There were things I liked and didn't like about this book. Firstly, I loathe weak, weeping heroines that can't do anything for themselves. Bree does nothing but fall in the mud and kick her reluctant husband in the crotch for no reason. And he hates women. Why? You never find out. Because he was a man whore as a young man I guess. Ruan's evil half brother forces him to marry an ugly fat chick because the evil brother sells his 10 year old sister to their enemy in marriage. This never made sense. If he's your enemy why would he agree to marry a child? So to get the marriage annulled after rescuing his little sister Ruan somehow ends up married to Bree, who responds by scratching and kicking her new husband and trying to run away. At first I liked the little sister, Merry, but then she turned into a little brat who would kick her brother (who saved her life) at every chance because he was starting to care for his new wife. They struggle with their feelings for one another because she's a woman and thus not to be trusted, and he's a man, thus he's going to beat her. I did buy the second book because the author stated this was her first book and I'm hoping experience shows in her second, but I just wasn't impressed and I'm glad I got it for free.",0

1662,1,"I have never given a book a one star review. That was generous for this drival. How this ever received positive reviews is boggeling. It was painful to read three chapters and not wonder at the age of the author and thinking maybe this was a grade school project. I could not even finish.  My 13 year old writes better stories and with less repeating of the same line and phrase again and again.  The reviews that rate this book good HAVE to be friends of the author and trying to boost her up, or else this was meant for grade school.",0

1664,2,"Wolf Signs was decent enough. The writing wasn&#8217;t spectacular, though nor was it horrendous by any measure. The storyline was easy to follow, simple and uncomplicated in a straightforward, honest way. It&#8217;s in the characters where I take up issue.TJ was my favorite things about this entire book. In the scene where Robyn first encounters him and his brother Keil, it was from his point of view, so I automatically latched onto him. It helped that he was fun and carefree, and Keil was being an absolute weirdo, sniffing the door Robyn had just slammed on them for like 5 minutes straight. I was kinda expecting more from him than to be shit on for the whole rest of the trip.And can we please address this whole predicament about Robyn stopping a bloody death-brawl showdown with her pheromones?! Someone alert the police, there&#8217;s another speshul snowflake among a pack of like 10 guys and only one of them is not opposed to jumping her like a rack of meat.Good God, there was nothing even remarkable about Robyn. The only thing that interested me about her was that she was deaf, and that was only because on my of main projects right now deals with a character who is mute and communicates through ASL. I wanted to see how well author Arend would handle the obstacle, but it&#8217;s hardly even a problem because Robyn can read lips, write witty things and, oh yeah, communicate telepathically with the one person she&#8217;s around for most of the story. And can speak anyway. With a pleasing, powerful voice, at that. Ugh.I liked the story. Kinda. It was short and sweet and a little engaging in some parts, at least in learning about the wolves and watching the attraction grow between Keil and Robyn, but there&#8217;s so much more negative to say about it (and most of the crap surfaces at the end, whereas the first half or so was actually enjoyable). Unfortunately, I&#8217;m just not interested in the unlikeable nature of these characters (and my favorite ones getting shit on left and right) to continue with the rest of the series.Oh and the instalove; I understand they&#8217;re mates, but holy crap, they spent like FIVE DAYS together&#8230;",0

I usually try to keep reading hoping it would be better but  it felt like I was back in school and the teacher made us read something that no one would like.

1667,2,"This is the conclusion of a trilogy (Black Moon,Amber Moon (Moon Trilogy Part II)).  Characters from the first two stories do make an appearance, but it is clear that the author designed these as three stand-alone stories.That decision didn't work well for me as a reader, so I want to address that first and then come back to my thoughts about this specific part of the story.When you're going to have your plot involve the destruction of the known world via mega-powerful artifacts, it's strange to have the treatment of the plot be so lightweight.  The author is using that plot as a vehicle to bring three couples together, but it's too significant of a plot line to be treated so carelessly.  In the end, you don't really care about the end of the world because you're missing so much necessary information.  Why would Elijah kill Jack's entire family and then leave him to get older, wiser, and stronger before their final showdown?  How come nobody with powerful magic could tell what Jack's true nature was?  Why would Mirie decide to get pregnant instead of helping avoid the destruction of the world?  Why not save the world and then get pregnant?  Why not enlist the dragons as allies earlier in the process?  Instead of helping us see how the different creatures work together, everybody just shows up when they need to.  How much more interesting would it have been to have this be the story of the Committee, working together with (good) werecreatures, elves, dragons, etc, to avoid this serious threat?In this specific story, Bevill's problem - as it was in the other two stories - is how to bring her main characters together in a believable way.  In the first two stories, she used the ""fated mate"" clich&eacute; - they see each other and immediately know they are to be together.  In this one, there are elements of that, but it is more of an ""you annoy me so much I love you"" thing, hardly less of a clich&eacute;.  It's difficult to believe that these characters could make it so far in their association without having a candid conversation, but we're expected to believe that.A plot that could be exciting is treated as a throwaway throughout three stories so the author can bring us the stories of three couples that she can't even make convincingly fall in love - both aspects of this series, and this particular story, are completely dissatisfying.",0

Put it down and downloaded two other books and have read and finished them while this one is still waiting to be finished. Perhaps as a whole when and if I get back to it, will be a good read. But for now it was pretty slow and didn't really make me want to keep reading it. A little disappointed in that regard but I haven't written it off yet.

No chief of police, or any lawman for that matter, would act this way.  They other characters weren't much better. And the plot, if you can call it that, really made no sense.  Badly written, and the end made no sense either. Who was the killer?  Why did he do it?  What was the point of the guy's voice at the convenience store? Who are these people that wrote these 5 star reviews?  What book did they read?  Sorry Mr. Cragg or Sebastian, I think you need to go back to your day job.  This was truly awful.  I am all for giving new authors a try, but will do a little more checking before I purchase from one in the future.",0

1677,1,"After some pretty solid writing in the first two books, especially the first, the writer seems to make some amateur mistakes that really are not acceptable.  For example, in the first two books the ship drive paradigm is wormhole drive with no time dilation.  In the third book, out of no where, there is suddenly time dilation but no change in drive technology and no explanation whatsoever.  The story barely requires it so I really don't understand how the author could make such a big mistake.  All three books carry a 2010 copyright, suggesting they were all written in 2010, so its hard to understand how the author cold have forgotten that his characters do not face time dilation with their wormhole drive.  However, far more disappointing is the lack of a satisfying climax.  The book is all buildup and it had so much potential, there were so many ways he could have gone with it, and then at the end a wimper.  I can't recommend this book, and since the 2nd one realy relies on this one for its resolution, I can't recommend that one either.  Read the first one and stop there.",0

1684,1,"While the price of this exceedingly short and very disappointing novella might entice you into downloading it... DON'T! I read it in less than an hour and with each minute that elapsed, each paged turned I kept hoping for something, anything intriguing to occur.From the opening paragraphs in chapter one, the book needed some serious editing. Typos like her for he and other pronoun switches were unbelievable.  Scenes described in one paragraph were contradicted later on. For instance the room, in Sara's apartment, was described initially as being empty. Yet two paragraphs later, the same room no longer was barren but had a couch that she laid on, a glass coffee table, a TV in the corner and several unpacked boxes. The author then concluded that the room was sparsely furnished... You don't say!The alley scene dialogue between Gedeon and Pryse was so passive and boring that it failed to get my adrenaline pumping. Gedeon, being a 450 year old vampire / healer, had the partial recipe for a concoction to convert vamps to day walkers. This part  reminded me of Wesley Snipes' 'Blade' trilogy movies. While Blade's  story lines were sci-fi plausible, this one was inane. Let's consider this, you are a healer with a recipe that allows vamps to become daywalkers and in the 450 yrs of your existence you have not perfected it. What have you been doing with your eternity Gedeon? Obviously lollygagging.In Kerrelyn Sparks' novels, when Connor drinks Roman Draganesti of RomanTech daywalking elixir, it bestowed upon Connor the ability to age several years, in addition to being able to walk in the sunlight and kill their rival Russian bad vampire sect in Brooklyn. Now that's a positive vampiric role model, not only did Roman create synthetic blood so vampires would no longer drain or force unwilling humans to part with their blood but he perfected his daywalking elixir.This novella  poorly blended plots from the Blade series and the Sparks novels and did an even worse job on the characters. Please don't bother wasting your time to download and read this trash even if it's free. I/ we should be paid for undergoing the torture of read this NO'novel'. Argh!",0

1690,1,"Okay, the best part of this story was the blurb and the book cover. It does a really good job of getting your interest in what promises to be a good read. However, the first thing I noticed was the lack of editing. Many paragraphs had two people talking in them so that you were constantly going back and forth between characters, and trying to make sense of it. The second thing was the hero was a jerk. He treated the heroine like crap. All he wanted was to have sex with her, even when he believed she was his brother's girlfriend. And then he did. What kind of brother does that? A big no no for me is also when the hero sleeps with other women,(implied) even if he and the heroine were on a break. Granted, they were on a break for 6 months but if he cared anything about the girl he wouldn't be jumping into someone else's bed.What irritated me about the heroine is she hates him one minute, and sleeps with him the next. She's wishy washy and her character is weak. You didn't get the feel that there was any real warmth, even real lust developing between them. The sex scenes were luke warm but it was more because of the author's choice of words than the actual act.And yet somehow they fall in love and she finally gets that proposal at the end.

Inconsistencies abound (slides a clip into a revolver; buys some fries and then tosses the empty donut bag into the trash, et al.).  Hyperbolic prose that REALLY needs trimming.  I will give the rough outline of the plot a decent score but in the telling, it gets muddled.  Too many Nancy Drew moments for grown-up fiction.  Also, the general tone is a ""dark and stormy night.""  A theme - small towns have bad things going on under the otherwise placid surface - is not a bad way to go, but elements of the story (the porn, Bobby Lee, et al.) get introduced and then go unresolved.

Lonely she hopes to find love someday and in walks in the mysterious Tristan and from that moment on her world is turned upside down.As excited as I was to read this book because after all I am such a vampire, lore fanatic. This book left me disappointed. I didn't feel the connection with the characters like I felt I should have.What I did like:I loved the premise-love triangle, fight bad guy. The fighting scenes and training was well done those I could visualize and root for the good guy so to speak and lastly it was a fairly fast read.What I didn't like:As I mentioned above and this is a biggy for me I just couldn't feel the emotions of the characters it felt flat. I wanted to but I just couldn't. But the downside for it being fast read is that I was left confused as we kept jumping along in the story- nothing really felt wrapped up.That being said would I recommend this book, well I think I will leave that up to you to decide.

For example, I happily hand over my Bouchercon and Left Coast Crime Conference fees and feel like I've won the lottery when I receive a bag filled with books. Seriously, this ends up being one of the major highlights of these conferences. So in my continued pursuit of this high, minus the conference fees, I have decided to scour Amazon for the best free short stories and books available. With that being said, let's get to the review.While ETERNITY EMBRACED packed plenty of passion into 44 pages, which should be enough to satisfy more than a few paranormal romance readers, this story still felt unsatisfying. I had trouble buying Andrea and Kaden's relationship within this tale's boundaries. A few more backstory details might have actually improved this story's momentum and made all that followed a bit more realistic.But, otherwise, it wasn't bad, as the pace and dialogue help up fairly well. And it cost me less than an hour of my time. On the other hand, I won't actively seek out more of this author's work, as I didn't exactly become more endeared toward vampires. Instead of embracing the undead, my first inclination would be to punch the unsuspecting fool and then hightail it out of there.Robert DownsAuthor of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigator",0
1702,1,"I'm really unsure how this book received an average rating of 4 stars. To be honest, I only reached about 15% of the way and I couldn't continue any further. I hate writing a bad review because I'm not an author and so I can only imagine the amount of effort that goes into writing a book, but the dialogue in ""Teasing Trent"" was pretty bad.The idea behind the story was good - hero is attracted to best friend's sister and she attempts to seduce him. The corny dialogue was not noticeable at first, but as soon as the sex scene began, the level of sophistication in the writing went downhill. It was honestly like listening to two teenagers losing their virginity and even in my head the voice of each character became dramatic and animated. When I started rolling my eyes and commenting aloud, I knew it was time to put the book down. Just some snippets:""Trent I've been dreaming about this for so long""""Look at me. Look at me as I take you""It gets worse. Five minutes after the hero declares he's not the type to settle down, he sleeps with the heroine. Five minutes after that, she is ""his"" and he is telling her that he has loved her for so long and he would be damned if he resisted any longer.....etc....etc...too sappy for me, but it may work for some readers.",0

Book 3  which should have come out in 2012  and book 3 in 2013 have not come out at all.There is no explanation on his website.Maybe his honesty got him into trouble with the copyright police and no more books will be coming out.At least he could have communicated this to his readers who are still paying for Book 2, even though he knows that he is not continuing the saga.If he is on hiatus, he should let us know, just like Stephen King did while writing his Gunslinger series.",0

I bought this because the plot seemed interesting--ancient vampire who has been disturbed by a young woman buying and moving in the old farmhouse over his lair.  It had promise--promise that the author couldn't fulfill.The book was written as if the author had a formula to write by: Introduce main characters, immediately have them have dream sex, then have male lead tell her that she is his one, and BTW he's a vampire and then have sex for the rest of the story.  No building up of the plot or tension between characters which lead to any type of climax (non-sexual type) and resolution.  The only vaguely dramatic scene happens off the pages--we see right before and after.  At least I know not to buy any more of her books.",0

Unfortunately, it was not interesting enough to hold my attention so I gave up on the book at the 60% mark. Like some of the other e-space books I have read, this seems more suited for a teenager, someone who doesn't mind the endless chores, the numerous trips to the mess hall and superiors who act like permanently cranky parents.

Now they are lumped in with the full cookbook.  The full cookbook may be much better and I really don't think Amazon should have the reviews for both put together.  My version had 10 recipes.

Yes, it was free, at least at the time of this writing, but even free things should reach to a certain standard.The story tells the tale of a group of Sith who crash-land on a mysterious planet. They promptly start fighting against each other while worrying that they might not be rescued or, possibly worse, they might be rescued and have to explain to the uber-boss why they don't have their valuable cargo.With the characters we see in this short story, there's also no one to really root for. There's no real character development, and several of the characters have similar names, which makes keeping track of who's who rather difficult. The action is somewhat confusing and poorly written as well.All in all, this is clearly supposed to be a teaser for a larger work. That's nice and all, but when the larger work comes out, I can just download the free preview text rather than something like this. It's also worth noting that this short story does not make me at all interested in reading the larger work.",0
1711,2,Well it was ok. I like the story . Just not the way it was told. The writing could have made it a lot better. I hate writing that but it's the way I see it. The story was ok though.,0
1712,2,"I could not make it through this book.  I am glad that it was free and that I did not waste actual money on it.  Bad.  I could not even get beyond the first few pages, and I tried on several occasions to read this.",0
1713,2,I downloaded this book thinking it was the classic ugly duckling but it was not! It was long & boring sorry :( & some of the words were to big for a child to understand very disappointed.,0
1714,2,"I read all the books in this series and although I didn't give them 5 stars, I did give them good reviews.  This book had too many childish games in it. The characters annoyed me to know end.  This book had so much potential but it fell flat for me.  I think I'll stick with Lora Leigh for my Navy men or Barbara Elsborg for more substance.",0
1715,1,"So, not the worst book I've ever read, but certainly not a good one!  Great concept, but the writing was lacking.  As another reviewer said, all the problems in the book were ""solved"" by having sex.  The sex scenes were good, if a little corny at times, (really, having sex while he sprouts wings and levitates them above the bed?!).  That's about the only thing this book was good for.  The author's descriptions of anything except the sex scenes were poor, (I never even felt like there was a decent description of what the dragon form looked like).  And the heroine was incredibly foolish and weak, repeatedly getting herself into scrapes he has to save her from.  I HATE stories with weak women constantly in need of rescue.Amazon needs to introduce a refund program, so you can get at least some of your money back for bad purchases.  If you're looking for a story with sex and not much else to recommend it, you'll probably like this one.  If you actually want a STORY to go with the sex, save your money and look elsewhere!",0
1716,1,I have to agree with others not one of her best.  Christian was always mad because of the attraction he felt towards the heroine and she was look I am such an innocent  dumb woman.  I had to skip pages in order to finish it.  I have read better stories from this author.,0
1717,1,"The writing is puerile, stilted and the entire thing sounds like it was written by a 15 year old boy.",0
1718,1,I think the plot is great but the profanity was a little more than I could take. I know this doesn't bother some people but for those like me...,0
1719,1,My idea of a romantic comedy is apparently not what others thought.  SPOILER ALERT: I could never under no circumstances forgive my husband for having sex with someone else. I just could not get past this towards the end of the book to enjoy the story. There were some funny scenes in the book but I wish I had just read something else.,0
1720,1,"Did she not have an editor??So boring! Terrible plot, ridiculous and unrealistic dialogue that the author obviously thought sounded clever but really came off as stilted and clumsy. I had zero interest in these characters from the 2nd chapter on. I had to force myself to read the second half of the book. Now I'm just pissed because I believed the other reviews and bought the whole series.I'd return them if I could.Don't bother with this book or this author. I certainly will avoid all her work in the future.",0
1721,2,I love a good story and this was a good story until the end. When it finally gets good the book just ends. I was so disappointed I don't even want to read another book by this author.,0
1722,2,"At 600 locations, this is a short, quick read, but not that scorching hot for me personally. I love menage stories with hot erotic sex, but this menage a quatre falls flat for me. An author really has to write menage well in order for the sex not to come across as rehearsed, that rote tab A into slot B feeling, which is how it felt to me when all the guys were finally in action together. I was really wanting that scene to pull through and to be great because up until that point I hadn't been that impressed with the writing or the eroticism displayed.I feel this story lacks any sort of real, make-you-sweat sexual intensity. Lines like 'his condom-clad c--- rising skyward like a pagan phallic altar' just didn't get me going. I never felt in the moment with these characters, and that's a big let down when erotic fiction doesn't grab me and make me participate. The sex here was almost like flicking through TV channels and briefly catching a glimpse of something only mildly sexy and only half-way interesting. For me, this was not erotic menage at its best.",0
1723,1,"These stories (&#60;--- not really a story) are just too short to engage the reader.  I read three of the stories(?) before I realized I was wasting my time, and they were not going to get any better.The pattern seemed to be write something postive, then move 180 degrees with a sentence to two.  Wait two sentences that would make the whole thing tooooooo long.  Can't have that!",0
1724,1,"I enjoy time travel tales, but not in the literary company of an annoyingly bitchy, clueless heroine whom we expect to be somewhat intelligent or  perceptive about people. She's a friggin' psychologist by profession!  But she understands less than nothing about human behavior in either the present or past, and seems incapable of understanding this skill no matter how many times she's slammed in the face with a learning experience.  The hero from the past is sweet, but in a century where he would have been far more ""worldly"" about the opposite sex, he's unbelievably clueless about his sexual allure. Aside from that, the story is too disjointed to hold together or tie together, and the sex is so random and unaffectionate that it's hard to believe it would happen at all.  The single star is based on hope: I'd like to believe the author's skills improved in later books.",0
1725,2,"There were a lot of interesting characters, in fact maybe too many. The ancillary characters were given a little too much significance, causing the need to bring too many pieces into the final closure. Just as a movie wouldn't seem real without the ""extras"", neither would a good book. However, when a clerk in a convenience  store says,""May I help you?"" in a movie, the director doesn't bring the clerks history into the movie. Ms Outroggeg gives far too much background on each person introduced and it leaves you rather confused at times. It also calls for some unbelievable endings to the assorted storylines. the main story was really good, but all the clutter sort of ruined the book for me.",0
1726,1,I found it extremely difficult to get into. Can't really complain only cost me .99 cents. gave it a go.,0
1727,1,I wasn't able to finish reading this.  It has a decent plotline but the language is contrived and forced and some of what could be interesting twists just turn absurd.  This could be much better with some heavy editing.,0
1728,2,"This WAS an interesting and horrifying book and the concept of taking fact and turning it into fiction, while not new, was interestingly done. This is a story of a family hit by what appears to be a senseless murder (not that any murder makes sense) on the same day that officer Freddie Nutter goes into labor with her daughter.  The book takes us through these frustrating events in fine detail, and is mostly seen by both Freddie the murdered woman's daughter and Sammy Gunn the murderer.I have several problems with a book like this - one is that the main characters displayed no strong emotion, or at least the author didn't manage to convey it to me.  We *are* talking murder here and in fine gory detail  during a very stressful time (delivering a baby).  If this is an aspect of Michiganites,to be stoic and cold, which I highly doubt, then the author should have taken the time to explain this.My second issue ---The problem with both main characters (Freddie Nutter and Sammy Gunn)is that they both experience pedophilia,  Freddie with her brother and Sammy with his mother, yet the author never really explores what that means to both of these people.  Don't forget that parts of this story are supposed to be true.SPOILER ALERT-------->>>>>>>>An interesting twist is in the last section of the book when Freddie's daughter and Sammy's son manage to find each other and form a deep  relationship, yet again the author doesn't explore this very deeply.All in all most of this book, while interesting and most certainly horrifying, was shallow and flat.",0

1731,2,"This book was cute, but I found it boring.  I am a big fan of the long lost love reconnecting genre, there are so many ways the story can play out.  This one just didn't seem to get that spark between the characters across.  I am also a big fan of the hot hockey player, Kip just sounded nerdy.",0

1733,2,"As I read this story I felt like a fan watching a crash at a NASCAR race. I kept trying to look away but I was drawn to see just how bad it could be. As 'Plan Nine From Outer Space' was to movies, this book is to Science Fiction.Stilted dialogue, complete ignorance of military aspects, one dimensional characters, abysmal grasp of science, a concept military vehicle that is so totally implausible that I laughed out loud, all blended together with a bizarre world view of how people behave. I kept thinking that the author was either brilliantly satirizing and mocking survivalist thinking or he was a horrifically bad writer. I still don't know.I gave the story two stars because the author made me determined to read book two of the series to find out.",0

1735,1,"Yes, it is a quick easy read, but even then, it is a waste of time.  I wish I had that half hour back in my life now.

And the story was, till it became all about some old house and there wasn't more shifting, everything happened in human form... Didn't like it very much so i just skipped to the end, although there was a nice surprise, it was still not what I thought it would be. It was a bit too mawkish for my taste. Besides I'm not so fond of a human having sex with the shape-shifted animal, which happens in this book.",0

1740,2,"Far too derivative for my liking as there were just so many similarities between this and the labyrinth from Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Magic school? Check. Four participants? Check? One of them wasn't originally supposed to be there? Check. Gender (and for some of them, personalities) of the participants? Check. The list goes on. There were a few original tidbits buried in there, but overall this novella is solidly a 2 star and no more.*Review re-posted from Goodreads.com",0
1741,2,"I just finished this book... well, it wasn't really a book.  It's only 1/3 of a book. It just stops partway through and you have to buy the rest of the series to see what happens.  Nothing gets solved in this book~ several different aspects of the Pandora's box of mysteries are opened up and leave you hanging.  I'm not interested enough to buy the rest.  Just annoyed that I wasted so much time hoping for something exciting to happen.This book is written from the first person perspective of a high school girl.  She's has special powers (she's a witch, but doesn't know it yet). She's also been from one foster home to another due to not being able to control her powers.  There is almost zero romance in this book, but a lot of teenage girl drama and it focuses around the cheerleading squad.  SPOILER:  Turns out they are all witches, or demons or whatever and there's something going on there.  Anyway, not my thing.  Too immature and lacks the depth and any real romance.There are a couple of different guys that she kisses, but the depth of emotion is totally lacking there and it just seems she can flick from one guy to another like a twit. Again, annoying.",0
1742,1,"Updated from March 12, 2012 to fix typos in review.Let me start this review with a brief synopsis of the plot as that is lacking in the description.The heroine, Catherine is in a miserable marriage.  She is married to a baron who, based on the storytelling appears to be somewhat mentally abusive.  Her husband is an alcoholic and appears to have some emotional issues.  She is considered the most beautiful woman of her time and her husband likes to dress her as a strumpet when he has the occasional gentleman over.  The hero, Adam is an Earl who is ""lured"" to the castle for a pair of twin horses.  He meets Catherine and based on her looks, falls instantly in love with her.  The question to be answered is how can Catherine and Adam be together given that she is married?  Is it worth scandal for their love to blossom?As I read this book, I find several things incredulous.  First, this ""love"" between Catherine and Adam isn't really that well developed.  I can believe she loves him as she was forced into this marriage at 17 and has been secluded since that time, and Adam does not stare at her breasts that are so amply displayed by her husband.  He is kind and loving to her and teaches her about passion.  However, based on what was told in this story, I am at a loss regarding Adam's love.  Everything that is described sounds like the lust of a tremendously beautiful woman (think, Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, etc.).  I don't see how they had enough non-physical interaction for him to fall in love with more than her face and figure.The author shows Catherine as a sweet and compassionate person despite the lack of such she has received from her husband, but never directly to Adam.  Additionally, there was a scene where the men who were hoping to gain Catherine's favors (she never presented herself as a woman who would grant any) crashed another soiree when they learned that was where she was headed next.  I found this to be absurd.The villain of the story, Catherine's husband Edgar did not seem much of a villain once his story was told.  I would have liked to see more of his story early rather than later in the novel and if done right, perhaps I could have excused the adultery.Overall, I can't really recommend this novel unless someone doesn't care about infidelity.  I found this novel to be weak, the adultery aside and did not care enough about the hero and heroine.  Yes, I finished it because frankly, I wanted to know more about the husband and, was curious to know how the author would get us to the happy ending that is expected in these types of novels.  Despite the novel progressing to the point where Catherine and Adam could be together, the ending left a lot to be desired as well.  I will not be purchasing any additional novels by this author.",0
1743,2,"I love a good Native American romance!  However, this is not one I even liked.  There are many parts in the book where I felt as though I missed some pages because parts that should have been very important are just glanced over.  For instance, there is a part in the book where it talks about a bracelet that the heroine got from the hero, but it doesn't show him giving it to her. If it was important to the heroine, then the story behind it should have been included.  This happens a lot and ruined the book for me.DISCLAIMER:This is only my opinion, I'm sorry if my opinion offends anyone else who just loved the book.  I don't tend to write many negative reviews, but the only other two I did write a couple of people were upset about.  Please feel free to read the book and find out for yourself.",0
1744,2,"The premise is a clever thought.  The characterizations are unpleasant caricatures. The ending is an abrupt unfunny, unclever 'joke'.  If you like Seinfeld (which I don't as they whined all the time and were unpleasant caricatures [except for the Soup Nazi, and the tall, gangly, crazy fella]), you might like this portrayal of a stupid, clueless, awkward guy and a greedy, self-centered, heartless gal, and a faceless yet ethical corporation.  I think the premise could be reworked into a much better story, as the author does have some talent - I think he's just learning and could be very good someday (he needs a good critical reader, like an editor).",0
1745,2,I love true crime books but this one had the very minimum detail and no ending so it was a very disappointing read.,0
1746,1,"I'm glad this was a free book. It wasn't badly written with typos and all that, it really wasn't what i expected. The title listed it as a short horror story. It was short but I did not think it was a horror story at all and as for the twist at the end ... well I didn't think much of that either.",0
1747,1,"While the plot sounded great, the writing makes this book unreadable. I'm afraid I didn't even get through the first page.Based on the first couple paragraphs, it was clear the author didn't know how to use semicolons or commas; I can't read a book that makes my hand itch for a red pen.If such things don't bother you, then perhaps you can enjoy this book.",0

Went from a joy to read, to a chore. I felt the characters were pretty under-developed, especially Dix. I can fit all I know about her on the head of a pin. The story was drawn out too much for my liking as well. The best part for me was the mystery. I was guessing and reassessing at almost every page turn.My biggest pet peeve was all the recapping of scenes. Like when a show goes to a commercial and it comes back they sometimes do a recap of where we left off. That garbage didn't start until the middle somewhere. Annoyed the hell out of me. I wanted to scream &#34;Dude! I just read this scene 1.5 seconds ago&#8230; I don't need a freaking recap!!&#34; At first I thought it was a copy & paste job, but the words aren't exactly identical. For that reason, I won't be reading the rest of the series.",0

I liked John's character because represents a solid, coherent man while I was very disappointed by Molly who started as a mature, no-judgmental woman and finished to be easily plagiarized by her sister. Molly is very confused and confusing for the poor John. Just one example of her irritating behavior is when she stops their first kiss and then complains because John apologies and doesn't try it again. In an attempt to make the plot less predictable, the author makes Molly to suddenly realize that John (who's a cop!!!) carries a gun and, sometimes, faces harsh encounters with criminals. The result is very poor and preposterous.",0

He is quickly sucked into their orbit.  The love story seemed a bit tangential to the story and most of the plot is conveyed during a pillow talk info dump towards the end of the book, making it difficult for me to care.The book isn't the worst written self-published paranormal out there, but there is certainly some room for improvement.Overall, the author's world isn't really one that appeals to me that much.  The details about the carni and the mani and the triat just seemed obviously contrived, as did the ending.",0

1764,2,"Wow, I hate to be the dissenter amongst what so far, has been very good reviews on this compilation of erotica shorts, but I was sorely disappointed.The worst of my disappointment stems from the underlying ""female empowerment"" theme of more than half of the stories.  This tone was so invasive to me that if it weren't for the title, I would have gone looking for it in the ""women's studies"" section.  Don't get me wrong, this is erotica, but 1)  it's VERY soft erotica (I'm talking cotton candy), 2) in my opinion it's geared more specifically towards women, and within that group, more specifically towards women with milder preferences, 3) the ""erotica"" component of most of the stories seem ancillary to the ""I am woman here me roar"" or ""I am becoming woman, here me roar"" theme.  I'm not sure how to explain it better without spoiling the stories within, but suffice it say that there is something about the characters in most of the stories that not only turned me off, it made me feel like going out and burning all my bras.  Yuck.On the bright side, even though each of these stories is written by a different author, I was very pleasantly surprised to find that each story was fairly well written (albeit somewhat bland) and fairly well edited.  Unfortunately, that's as much praise as I can lavish on this compilation.For me, the door is wide open as far as what I can enjoy in the erotica genre, but I need to have at least ONE of these things to enjoy the story:  1)  well-done erotic elements that elicit either a visceral or mental reaction, or 2)  exciting elements that keep me turning the pages either for the sake of the story or because I love the characters, or 3)  stellar writing talent.  I didn't get any of those.  Judging by the positive reviews here, there is clearly a market for this book, I'm just not a part of it.",0
1765,1,"I honestly cannot believe people actually thought this book was worth 5 or even 4 stars. This was the worst book I've read to date. I've never read a book where I wanted it to end so badly. I finished ONLY because I like to finish books before I critique them.  I don't want to bash the author but I have to be honest here.The plot: Bride-to-be, Shanna finds out by supposed friend, LeToya, that her fiance, Kevin was kissing another man, Ben, on their wedding day.  Shanna runs out on the wedding and  decides to skip town by escaping to an Island where she meet top security guru Ross. They have a one-night stand ( and them some)  and Shanna begins to find contort in Ross. Later, Shanna returns home to find she is being stalked by a mystery person and starts receiving unknown phone calls as well as a robbery to one of her hair salons. She hires Ross to do some investigation and what they discover is a world of lies and betrayal by those who are closest to Shanna.My Take:This book for one, was horribly written. The plot had all the potential to be taken to the next level and failed... miserably. Granted, I understand this is an erotica book, but I was disturbed at how Shanna was able to find what the book described as ""passion"" in Ross not even knowing him for a day! For someone who just found out here fiance might be gay, she took it way to light for my liking.Aside from that, the plot ending up dying because they entire book was about Shanna and Ross having sex. I found myself skipping over several parts just to get back to the point of the story. Instead, of given details, readers are just told what happened. In all honestly, I would have rather had more details than all the sex. And BTW, the sex scene were't even good!!!! Double whammy!Overall I had more problems with the books then likes. Come to think of it, I can't say one thing I did like about the book. Not enough details, too predictable, plot that went south after page 1, and BAD SEX SCENES was just too much for me to bare.This was my first time I've read a book from this author and I'm almost inclined to say it will be my last. However, I like to give authors a couple of tries before I cut them off entirely. I will be skeptical however when I see other books by the author.  I hope she has produces better products because if this is the best she's got, then she will not be writing for much longer.I won't say I don't recommend this book because we all have our own likes and dislikes but don't be surprised if this isn't what you expected after reading it.",0
1766,2,"I was disappointed in this book as I have read other books by this author and I didn't think it was as good, it was also a very very short story.

1767,1,"Even after years of reading self-published stories on Amazon, it is possible to find stories that blow the mind, exploding all previous conceptions of the nature of terrible writing.This is one of those times.In describing the plot and phrases used in this story to my husband, he suggested that a new category had been created, that of ""cold shower erotica,"" erotica that actually suppresses sexual desire.  Upon finishing this story, I recommend that the reader quickly find somebody attractive to look at or an decent erotic story to read in order to prevent a permanent shutdown of the sexual drive.Jordie is a successful rock star.  He thinks he is gay because he enjoys having sex with men, but it turns out he just hasn't met a woman who knows how to use soap yet.  Sapphire (yes, Sapphire) is a beautiful seventeen-year-old fan with ""anime-like eyes"" who wins a ""Best Night Ever"" contest and gets to meet him.  He quickly notices that she has used soap before and decides that this whole ""gay"" thing was a mistake.  After reflecting on both the abuse by an older male cousin and the beyond disgusting details of the first sexual experience with a woman that made him determine he was gay (because that is how homosexuality works, people!), he proposes that he eat her ""furry little burger.""However, after the trip down Memory Lane, the reader is excused if Jordie's sweet nothings fail to arouse (let's just hope said reader isn't eating cheesecake while reading as Kavay assumes that we have no idea how to picture the symptoms of a severe yeast infection without a descriptive assist).  Every time the author gets into a groove of anything slightly erotic or romantic, she's compelled to wrench the train off the tracks with a disturbing plot twist or a gross visual.Let's see . . . there is Sapphire describing her terrible childhood and how her uncle is planning to rape her at his hunt camp in a matter of hours, the above-mentioned encounter between Jordie and a slightly older girl when he was a teenager, Jordie's observation that Sapphire knows how to keep herself clean (is this something rare?), and the actual details of the coupling between Jordie and Sapphire.  The story is clearly for those who like it rough, but the combination of Jordie's perceptions of the female form and Sapphire's ""do-whatever-you-like-and-I'll-just-take-it-because-it-is-better-than-being-raped-by-my-uncle"" attitude that is really stomach-turning.And let me just add that the best way to end a first time anal scene isn't to have the penetrator check when he's done to make sure that he didn't create ""little anus hemorrhoids.""  I really could have done without that final visual.In summary, the story is more stomach-churning than erotic; the entire undercurrent of the story is extremely misogynistic and yet also anti-gay; and I'm pretty sure that Sapphire, with her body that is so much cleaner than that of other women, her ability to write amazing song lyrics, her endless desire for pain, her wonky name, her ""anime-like eyes,"" and her terrible situation that only Jordie (and not, say, law enforcement) can save her from is a stand-in for the author herself.This is it, people.  This is among the worst of the worst.  Proceed with extreme caution.",0
1768,1,"Five stars? Seriously??I am almost at a loss for words this series is so bad. I just learned these are self-published, and I think that explains a lot. While these would never be powerhouse YA books, a good editor would have at least made them a fun throwaway read rather than these tedious, repetitive slogs.The main character is one of the least interesting teen leads ever. She is unlikeable, and makes bad decisions that end up in strange acts of violence perpetrated on her - repeatedly. Why are you running back into the forest? Why are you following someone who wants to kill you  - again? Why are you such a jerk?The amount of unnecessary violence among these teens is just odd. Girls are slapping, kicking, cutting and punching each other constantly. Is this what the author believes goes on in high schools? And Skyla breaks a bottle and cuts the face of the boy she loved two days ago because she doesn't like what he did? Throats are cut, arms are chopped off and all with no real purpose for either character or story advancement.The books draaaaaaaaaaag on to the point of repetition and boredom. Nothing happens. Nothing ties together. The teenagers are by and large repulsive. Girls get knocked up and don't care. It's like a town full of socio & psychopaths rather than celestial beings.What a waste of time and money- I was looking for fun beach reads, so not after literature. These books are frustrating because there is so much more the author could have done with the concept. Instead, it feel like opportunistic coat-tailing on the paranormal trends. These 8 books could have been 3 good ones rather than an unwieldy mess strewn across so many sub standard books.",0

I'd read one chapter of the book and do one chapter in my text book, and repeat and repeat and repeat.I had very good memories of the stories.Unfortunately they didn't feel anywhere as good as they used to. I'm giving it two stars and not just one because in its own day it probably wasn't as bad as it is today. The wooden dialog was almost impossible to bear.",0
1771,1,"You know, I hardly EVER give a book one star. But this book...*sigh* where do I start?First off, I'm not against light reads. I read my share of them and most of the time find them enjoyable. But there's light and there's light. This is dandelion fluff light. So light that the plot seems to have blown away into thin air.M. L. McClure has her share of devotees but I should have listened more closely to the reviews. Very few comment on the plot. It's just ""all about the kissing"". And folks, seriously, it is. I mean, there's little else. It's like the author draws two characters(so they can kiss) Oh no! Make it four; (you know, more to kiss); there. Ok, now where can they kiss? Lets see...how about a prairie kiss? Then lets go to the river and have a river kiss? Hey, meet me by the barn and we'll kiss again! And have you seen the tree house? Well, let me SHOW you! *kiss kiss*. It was THE WHOLE STORY!!! And each kiss (and lead up) may be two or three PAGES!.Hey, I like romance as much as the next person but give us a REASON TO CARE.And it was so Disney. Enter poor clumsy heroine and hero hunk. Hero hunk loves poor clumsy heroine over all others (though he can have his pick) for no reason other than she's adorable and  he's older and wiser (and can teach her to kiss). He rescues her non stop through every scrape. She falls in a mud puddle. Guess who's there to pull her out? Enter abusive Daddy, Prairie Prince to the rescue!She's being chased by murderers, have no fear, Prairie Prince is here (on his stallion no less).*SPOILER*  They kissed.The one redeeming feature of this book is it's short.

1773,2,"Based on the blurb, I should have loved this book. Or at least liked it. But I didn't. The story read as though it so badly wanted to be 'horror' but it really fell short. It wasn't scary and it just didn't grab my interest. Possibly because the child, Kevin, irritated me. Maybe because Maury and his love interest, a dream-being, annoyed me. I don't know. But then again, this might be one of those books that proves that reading is subjective, since I can't put my finger on exactly what bothered me, yet a boatload of other people enjoyed it.",0
1774,1,"Good thing this was a western because this writer knows how to beat a dead horse.  I could not finish this book.  The author was intent on filling the first quarter of the book with visions&#8212;the same visions, ad nauseam.  This was regrettable because I feel the author has the potential to be a good writer. This is fragmented, taking too long to get to the plot (if there was one).",0

1776,2,"I didn't exactly like this book but I didn't hate it either. It is very long without any real story going on. The Character's aren't consistent and neither is the plot. Here are my problems with it:1. Jasmine (the heroine) she starts off seeming strong and independent. Then becomes immature at times and even submissive and sometimes flaky. Then she's back to acting strong again. She keeps flip-flopping from one way of thinking and acting to another.2. Keilan (her love interest) starts off seeming concerned about scaring her and not wanting to harm her in the beginning. He then turns into a dominating molester within the next chapter or so. He again becomes a sweet romantic love interest halfway in the book then dominating again. It's very confusing who these people are and what they are about. There were many other characters mentioned but you barely know them or understand where they are coming from either.3.The genre didn't seem to fit what was actually in the book. Yes there is some romance, there is fantasy/sci fi but there is also erotica in the book. I wish the author picked a genre and just went with it instead of tried to blend so many in one. She goes into descriptions of each in different scenes but the tone and feel of each scene doesn't always feel like the same book. Primarily the sexual aspects seemed really obscured compared to the rest of the book. I wish she would of just chose Full erotic novel OR Full romantic novel. Neither aspects seemed to blend together or stayed consistent in this book. Also the sexual aspects were so few and far between in the first half of the book that it seemed out of place.4. OK so the book is about a girl with Charmer abilities (can seduce shifter men with her scent basically) who happens to be best friends with a shifter princess. Why should we, as the reader, care about this and what does it have to do with the story itself? I'm not sure about that answer. Again if this was a full erotic novel some of the sexual themes and her seductive powers would make more sense. Like the sexy clothing and underwear in the beginning, is suddenly forgotten after the first &#34;molesting scene&#34; then she's able to wear dresses and regular shirts and pants. What was the point of that?? And a scene where an aphrodisiac was used then backfired to cause a loss of sex drive just didn't fit in. But since this is a romantic/action/fantasy I think?? I'm not sure why we should care or where the author was taking us with all this. Or why so many things were mention just to be resolved and forgotten about within a page or so later.So in a nutshell, there were things about it I liked. Things I didn't like and things that just didn't make sense to me. There were a lot of scenes and characters that could have been cut from this book to give it a more focused feel and shorten it. I hope the author chooses to rework this one and give it  more structure. She had a lot of cool ideas and interesting world she created but I feel her story needs more planing. I will not be following the series but I enjoyed most of the journey in this book.",0

Business people, especially when we're reading, like explanations or examples in a seperate font to better understand exactly where the author is coming from.The approach of avoiding the perception of being a sales person makes sense. His methods DO work, but is there anything earth shattering? No.One aspect I completely agree with is regarding referrals! There is a far easier approach to gain access to referrals easier. This method should be added to this book, and is an amazing tacticWhich you can read here. What makes sense about the approach mentioned, is I have used it extremely successfully and have had web site owners call or search for me - if that isn't a perfect example of gaining business by unselling I don't know what is!

1788,2,"Tonya Kinzer, &lt;strong>The Contract&lt;/strong> (Smashwords, 2011)First off: if you're a writer of ""erotica"" and you don't know how to correctly spell the word ""come"", that tells me a great deal about your education in the world of erotic writing.Not that this is terribly surprising from someone whose book is crammed full of stilted, formal dialogue and odd bits of explication that make this read more like someone was trying to write a textbook (but make it hip and accessible) rather than a piece of fiction.As well, there are odd little snatches that just don't make sense. Given that the male in this scenario is the dom and the female is the sub, once you get past a certain point in their relationship, the phrase ""To his surprise..."" really shouldn't appear anywhere in the narrative, especially if you're (""you"" here being ""the author"") making a point of letting us know that the sub in question is extremely easy to read.Given a few sessions with an extremely aggressive editor, the author might have here the first few chapters of a workable novel. What we have here, on the other hand, is very much still in rough draft form. * ",0
1789,2,"This book was just ok. I was really looking forward to reading this one because it was a different take on the menage story. Instead of coming in on the part of the couple's story when their relationship was just starting we come in on the middle where it's on the verge of ending.I'm beginning to wonder if maybe I expect too much from my taboo or erotic reads.  For a romance I expect likable characters for the leads, characters that even if I don't agree with what they do that at the least I'll understand why. Both of those factors were missing in this book.  Logan the alpha male in the threesome was all alpha and not at all likable.  Usually I am the first one to jump up and root for an alpha male, but in this case there were very few redeemable qualities to be found in Logan.  As a reader you understand Catherine loves him, but why?  Rhys was better than Logan in that at least he was likable, but that was it.  There was nothing wonderful about him.To me the story would have been better if Catherine had stuck to her resolve even once,  made them really work for something. It just seemed that at every turn Catherine was giving in and going along with what they wanted.  In the end I found myself  just skimming the last few chapters. I'd recommend skipping this one.Stats:Ebook pages: 118 of actually storyGenre:  erotic, menage romanceRe-Readablitiy: NoneSteam Factor: Hot",0

1791,1,"I like reading menage and unconventional relationship books, and after reading Night is Darkest, I really had high hopes.  This book however was cringe-worthy and just plain bad.  There were so many plot holes, and I was amazed I didn't fall into one.  They are so obvious, that several times I put the kindle down, and vented to my friend over how stupid some of the scenes were. I was amazed that while my eyes were rolling, they managed to stay inside my head.  Razor was shot in the last book, and is still recuperating - yet despite his physical condition, his department sends him undercover to be a contestant on a ""Dancing Like the Stars""-type competition.  Huh?  The heroine escapes a bad situation with money and a Ferrari (which she proceeds to park in a bad neighborhood) - but no one steals the car.  Oookkkay....  She hides in plain sight...on a tv show...and they get 2 days to practice....and still she manages to teach her partner everything, her physical injuries from the previous situation don't impede her ability to wear heels, no one seems to notice bruising....and her custom made dress is done in under 24 hours.  Alrighty then.  Not to mention the most disturbing scene - I actually cringed my way through it.  The cops need to verify the heroine's virginity status.  Despite two of them being married to a nurse, they choose to send Razor and another friend into a bedroom to verify the status themselves.  Yep - that's how to do it.  Why go to a hospital....a doctor...the aforementioned nurse....when you CAN DO IT YOURSELVES!  And regardless of the cringed and creeps that scene gave me - it somehow devolved into an opportunity for her to give him oral sex.  Really?  Seriously?  Bleech.  And because I am on a roll, all of the officers go on stakeout inside a sex club.  But the second they hit the door, they are all bumping and grinding.  Good thing they were on the clock - would hate to see what they would get up to in their free time....oh wait....I cannot begin to express how disappointed I was with this book.

After doing so he comes up with the idea that he should do this more often, recruiting other children.

1793,2,"This is not a cogent tale.  In deecription it states this is a short to get rid of someone so that Elizabeth can go on with her life unencumbered with Devlin near.  Then, stating one always ends up where they belong.  Well, not really then - not if one character has to be rid of for the other to be with another.  It felt like the author had the attachment to Devlin, not Elizabeth.  Which allowed more sense to tale overall than the thoughts within.Devlin's monologues were confusing at best in trying to convey the process to Elizabeth.  He never succeeded fully and her decision was not made in full knowledge - even though it brought resolution for her.  Though the resolution was a dissatisfacory conclusion overall.  For, it is unclear he fulfilled his wish.  And, rebirth would not disencumber the soul mate factor (of reincarnation) - rather it merely sets up a new generation of life of searching for missing piece.  Many believing in reincarnatiin will be dissatisfied with the solution given here as sever as the souls are what is connected and reincarnated - not the bodies.  I realize Devlin is a ghost and is found in a dream - however, that connect is as strong as merely feeling a presence (unseen) around a person.I cannot say whether Elizabeth's story outside this short finds resolution or not as I have not read the full the author alludes to.  However, this short is a confusing and implausible resolution to author quandary of Devlin character as it stands for this piece she calls a stand alone.There were a number of errors that should not be found in a piece this short.  It should be scrubbed free of punctuation and grammar errors.Christine",0
1794,1,"This is analogous to those straight-to-video movies that end up in the $3 bin at Big Lots. Somehow, they are produced, written and made; but in so many cases, you end up wondering...what were they thinking?In this case, the author seems to have stitched together a ponderous book with a plot line that simply makes no sense. Earth's ozone layer has failed, evidently causing a caste system in which some unspecified ""elite"" end up in domes, and the rest of humanity ends up...not in domes, evidently too stupid to stay indoors. To try to make this all plausible, the author creates a new kind of radiation: One that apparently deteriorates concrete, steel and brick so that it crumbles. Not the domes, of course: somehow, THOSE materials are impermeable.Scratching your head yet? How about these little gems:--The futuristic military is ultra-smart, ultra-mechanized, and ultra-equipped...except when they have to go somewhere in the dark. Then, they fumble and stumble around because in this universe, night vision goggles were never invented.--The outside-the-dome citizens are emaciated, radiation-ravaged and prone to bleeding and dying at a moment's notice...except when the citizens are related to the main character. Then, they perform superhuman feats over several days with various injuries and little food with no apparent problems.--In a world where all the land is described as arid, lifeless and barren, half the characters drown their sorrows with a good cigarette. Which is made of tobacco. Which is grown...where exactly?--The author has decided that virtually every noun deserves an adjective and every verb deserves an adverb. Glass never breaks - it breaks softly. Honestly. No one ever stares - they universally stare coldly or hotly, and both words are apparently interchangeable to the author. I daresay there are 3,000 completely superfluous words in this novel attributable to useless adjectives and adverbs.Indeed, there are whole passages that are redundant and serve to do nothing to advance the story. In this universe, military men conduct 20-minute long conversations to debate the pros and cons of helping a stranded soldier in the middle of an epic battle, and the dialogue is incessant in its repetition.Even with an editor and a halving of the story (and believe me, it would be easy to cut this novel in half), there is simply no character development that makes you want to root for the hero or his family. Oh...and the sequel? It contains virtually no ties or links to the initial story.All in all, this is one hot mess of a book. With so many other quality independent titles and authors out there, I can't recommend this even at its current zero price. Your time is still worth something; spend that time in something more fulfilling.",0

1796,2,"After exhausting many of the greats in romantic suspense like Christy Reece, Pamela Clare, Cindy Gerard, Linda Howard, Maya Banks, Laura Griffin and a few others, I've been having a hard time finding that next great author for this genre, so I've essentially been trying everything which leads me to this story.  I read the reviews of the Tall, Dark, and Deadly series and wanted to give it a try, and what better way than to read the Prelude story.  It started out very strong and I liked the chemistry between the H/h and the backstory of how Lindsey, a powerhouse attorney lost her mojo on a case gone wrong, went to work for the FBI, and reluctantly comes home to help her sick father with his law firm, only she can't do it alone and needs the help of her father's former law partner, Marc Reeves. She's also the target of a serial killer who's wrapped up in the case that killed her career as a lawyer.Now, I'm a sucker for smart, capable women as heroines who aren't sitting around waiting for a man to rescue them and what better segue to do that than have an incomparable legal brain along with some gun toting FBI skills?I guess it all boils down to having a great idea for a story does not equate to writing a good story.  It's almost as if this author woke up one day and said, ""I have an idea for a great story"" and then proceeded to write said story without any research.  The fact that the story includes lawyers and FBI is completely irrelevant since there's nothing in the story that reflects knowledge or experience with laws and/or criminals.  There's a serial killer with hits in three major cities with the same modus operandi and there's no mention of VICAP and each murder is being handled by local law enforcement, separately, with no FBI involvement.  Gun are just guns, no make or model, and apparently the FBI hardly even wears them, nevermind uses them. I also have no idea what division of the FBI these people even work for. When in Vegas, the payout for hitting single number in roulette is 35 to 1, not 20 to 1.  All that aside, it was still an okay story, but when you add in an obnoxious headstrong woman, with some serious daddy issues, who is supposedly smart but constantly does stupid things over and over again and blames everyone but herself for her problems, well, it slides downhill from there.  That and I found myself angry by the ending based on a blatant display of complete ineptitude.She does get the definition of a hero right and I felt sorry that Jake was stuck with Lindsey by the end of it.  Without the research and depth to the characters, she should stick with something neutral like meeting on a beach or something, not a story where careers, procedure, training and details matter.",0

1799,2,"This book has the almost identical name to The Crystal Warrior (The Crystal Warriors) - a series by Maree Anderson (Aug 12, 2011).I was asked by Story Cartel to provide a reflective and honest appraisal and would not have given my time for free if I did not think there was a lot to like in this story.That said - well lets keep it brief:FROM THE TEXT OF THE NOVELLarissya was holding her dying grandmother in her arms when she felt it. The lump in her left forearm was moving! She looked up weakly and smiled. ""It is time, Larissya,"" she whispered, and handed her the blade.Look at rule eleven in Strunk and White's popular English-usage book, The Elements of Style. ""A participial phrase at the beginning of a sentence must refer to the grammatical subject.""BETTERLarissya watched the lump moving in her dying grandmother's left forearm. Her grandmother became limp in Larrisya's arms and she whispered, ""It is time Larissya."" The golden quarlam blade pulsed with light and slipped from her ancient fingers to the cold damp floor of the cave._____How does one `look up weakly'? How is Larrisya holding her grandmother in her arms AND feeling the lump in her grandmother's forearm at the same time? I assume  Larrisya has three hands.No exlamation mark is needed. The change also cleans up the narrator's confusion between the characters - a perplexing problem that continues throughout the novel. The author has a real and persistent problem with point of view. Here, for example, Larissya seems to have a lump in her forearm but further reading reveals that is the grandmother that has the lump in her forearm instead, not Larissya. Larrissya is also the subject in the sentence, 'She looked up weakly and smiled ...' however, it is the grandmother who looks up weakly and smiles.Then a few lines later where we have, ""What are you saying?"" Larissya asked, looking down at her ancient, gnarled face. `Gnarled' is only used for limbs and joints - it means knobbly, twisted. `Weather beaten' is more correct and can be replaced by gnarled if it refers to limbs - not faces. For a weather beaten face use `weather beaten' or `leathery' or some more appropriate adjective that refers to old skin.Then we have a new character appear out of nowhere called Althea - who is then revealed as the grandmother.And on and on it goes.Nearly every character uses the same voice as the narrator.In the end this proved to be almost impossible to continue reading and the call kept getting louder and louder in my mind, `Where is the editor?"" What incompetent let this novel get to print? Whoever edited this seriously needs to find a job as an errand boy or girl.Paradoxically, it is a ripping yarn. It is just destroyed by a writer who appears not to have done any rewrites - or does not know what a rewrite entails. This novel does not make me fall into its world - far too many reality checks. Far too many calls to the critical brain to stay alert for who is who and what is going on and just feeling disoriented by the unimagined physics of simply holding, standing and walking. These characters need extra body parts just to function in the world of the story. The comic book nature of human anatomy, such as cutting your foream to the bone is simply ridiculous and so the story loses me as I contemplate loss of arterial blood. Oh, and where is the light coming from in this cave?My advice - put the manuscript in a drawer for at least six months. Don't look at it. Then come back to it as a naive reader and red pencil every single faux pas. Then do a first rewrite. Then examine each and every dialogue tag and kill each and every adverb. Then when you can't find any issues hand it to a proper editor - who will find hundreds. At core, this is a wonderful story and it deserves that professional respect.The five star reviews for this book should look up the word 'shill'.",0

1801,1,"I am an avid reader and a huge fan of Leah Brooke. Her books was the first erotic books I ever read and I placed her on my top ten author list for erotic novels. As far as I am concerned she is as good as Maya Banks, Lauren Dane, Shayla Black, Lora Leigh ect. However, this book, I am not sure what went wrong but this is one of her worst. The story feels incomplete like everything in the book was just thrown together haphazardly. I did not like Elizabeth, I thought she was selfish, unforgiving and a proud woman who made stupid choices as a child and then proceeded to blame others for her own mistakes. Her daughter although really cute was just so undisciplined and spoilt and her mother had no control. I liked Chandler but could not find a liking for Hayden (although I loved the names). What could have been a great book just flopped all around.What attracted me to Ms. Brooks books was the way she develops the relationships between her characters. She took her time with each character and you get to know them, you relate to them. I also loved the way she develops her characters romantically, sexually, mentally and emotionally and that's what attracts me to her writing and her books. This is not the norm for Ms. Brooks. I believe ALL authors have a few books that are not going to be good and I believe this is one for Ms. Brooks. I hope to continue reading her books in the future. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book.",0
1802,2,"Dead wives, car crashes, demons, sword fights, daughters in peril, ridiculous and hard-to-pronounce &#34;fantasy&#34; names, more demons, reincarnations . . . . and this is a short story.  It starts in the realm of the everyday and we're taken so quickly into this elaborate fantasy world that it's difficult to keep up or care about any of the characters.",0
1803,2,"Even though there aren't any glaring grammatical errors, the writing is still off.  The author slips into modern speech at times while the story clearly is a Regency historical. Plus, I just couldn't connect to the characters. They come across as one dimensional and cartoon-like.  If you're looking for really well written erotic historical books, read any of Robin Schone's or Madelynne Ellis' work. Skip Laurel Bennett. This book is a waste of time.",0
1804,2,"Even though I am in my 30's I still read a wide range of books, probably because I work in a Teen Center. After all the reviews on this book and the series, I got it when it was free one day and decided that I would give it a chance. I put it down several times because I could not understand why the author was doing the things she was. There was no flow of this book, the plot was thin and it bounced around so much that I barely understood what was going on, not to mention trying to figure out the WHY of everything. I think that this was a superficial try at a book and a series that would appeal to a much younger crowd but I wouldn't let my teenager read this.",0
1805,1,This book is terrible.  It is really just a personal diatribe about religion and abortion.  This is not an alternative history tale.  I wish there was a way I could get my money back.,0
1806,2,"Decently written, at least. No major grammatical errors. The romance was a bit tepid, and the heroine was completely unsympathetic. Her life was clearly in danger, but she just &#34;had to&#34; go off on her own without telling anyone to &#34;clear her head&#34;? Just one, in a long line of actions, that led me to believe that she was insanely stupid. I started to feel a bit sorry for the hero for having to put up with her constant temper tantrums over imagined slights. Then again, the hero's character was so poorly fleshed out, I found I could care less about him.",0
1807,1,This was the dumbest book I ever read. I guess i thought it was actually more then a food fight. But it was probably 5 pages long and that was too long. dont waste you time on this one.,0
1808,2,"Like Angel'sI Got Some Bad Muse For You, this story represents a dubious idea stretched out . . . with some Shakespeare thrown in.  The characters are super-thin and the ""jokes"" often fall flat.  If your idea of a typical Southerner is a guy in overalls who carries a shotgun in his lap at the insistence of a father who insists that his college-age daughter take a chaperone to the movies, then this story will be right up your alley.  But of course they all love Shakespeare!  What a terrific joke, huh?",0
1809,1,This author makes you appreciate good authors who can actually write.  Sorry to her friends who've been posting the reviews on here but the writing was pretty stilted and amateurish.,0
1810,2,"I bought this novel back in 2012, so when I finally got the chance to read it, I was more than thrilled, but then I was let down immensely. The novel begins with two girls, Beckett Smith and Chloe Baker, at the Aurora Bridge, talking about an event that has taken place before the novel started. Honestly, I think I would've enjoyed this novel a lot more if it was told from both Beckett and Chloe's point-of-view, but it wasn't. It was only told from Beckett's point-of-view. Also, I didn't really connect with any of the characters. I'm not sure if this was because of the characters or the way the story was told. Overall, I wasn't really a fan of this novel, however, I do think that this novel could help a lot of young people who is struggling with being accepted and is considering suicide...this novel teaches you that there is never a reason to go to that extreme, and I absolutely loved that aspect about this novel.",0
1811,1,I figured since it was by lora leigh it would b good. No such luck. I just pissed away over $5 on a 65 page book that held no plot nor character development. Absolutely awful and a waste of money. There were 2 decent sex scenes. That was it. No back story. No details. Long review short. Don't waste your time or money on this so called book. It's a waste.,0
1812,2,"...not much of a tale ... not much of anything really. I guess it was supposed to be some sort of parody, but it really fell flat on most levels. The humor is really dull, and the story twist is barely there. Fairly well-written, though.",0
1813,2,"I'm seeing a common thread in some of these reviews and I have to agree to feeling frustrated when I got to the end. There wasn't one! It felt like a story that was chopped for the sake of making a series. However, the characters were good and the story interesting.",0
1814,2,"I know all the nasty things that Linda does to Mike are supposed to be funny, but I honestly just found them tedious (oh no, it looks like Mike is wearing makeup again. . . in JAIL!).  It felt as if everybody - Mike, Linda, the gay couple next door - was just a stereotype instead of a character.  I don't know much about ghosts, but wouldn't even part of a body be sufficient for Linda's purposes?  I don't know much about killing, but who would choose that method of body disposal?You need a deft hand to make such sustained nastiness seem funny.",0
1815,1,"A thriller suggests a page-turning suspense-filled experience. Though here the author gives us some accurate Cape Cod locations, nothing else is satisfying. This is a boring thriller. More talk than action. No real suspense. Major disappointment.",0

1817,1,"I am usually pretty laid back with cozy mysteries.  This one was sad from the very beginning.  Not to spoil anything but a husband who is assassinated and never gets to see his baby?  There wasn't any humor to it at all and in fact, about 4 chapters into it, I stopped reading it and was glad I didn't buy the whole set.  Too dark.",0
1818,2,"A love story worth sharing.  More of a highschool sweetheart type fiction. Just delightful enough to content the reader with a warm, fuzzy feeling and a strong dark overtone.  Not scary enough, though.",0
1819,1,The animal mutilation and racial slurs are superfluous. very disappointing and  quite frankly---  a  deal breaker. Just sayin'  A warning would have been appreciated.,0
1820,1,"Obviously I did not enjoy this book.  I'll just give you the biggest reasons.1.  The main man in the book turns out (for me) to be quite unlikeable.  He has very little sympathy for the main female character.  I personally like a man who is sympathetic and helpful when my world is falling apart.  He just becomes sarcastic and horny.Which leads me to2. Lack of romance.  Descriptive sex scenes that lack emotional passion really do nothing for me.And finally3. Ironically, even though I disliked the book, one of its main faults was how short it was.  The plot really needed more time to develop fully- I felt completely confused by the whole ""realm"" explanation (or lack of it).  I also feel that the characters weren't allowed to play out their relationships nearly enough.  Perhaps, though, I am just hoping that if the story was longer the main man would have had more time to romance his woman.If you have absolutely nothing else to read, go for it.  Otherwise choose the other book, whatever it is!",0
1821,2,"Once again if it doesn't grab me right off, I don't waste my time reading it and that's what this was for me.  I have a short attention span if it doesn't interest me and this one didn't.  Plain and simple.",0

1826,1,"The book has potential, but characters are underdeveloped, and situation is not well explained.Instant connection is possible, but has to be backed up by the way characters interact, and of course, time. This is not the case here. One moment it is ""I trust you"", ""You are mine everything"", and the next there are accusations of the foulest nature. Not consistent, both in regards to characters and the story line.Besides, book cover promises one thing and the book does not deliver ;-)",0

1828,1,"I missed the note about ""explicit content"" so I was quite shocked when I started reading. It starts out with very sadistic descriptions and grossly described sexual situations. Plus, it is deliberately written with no capitalization which is very hard to read. I have no idea how this book ended up on the Top 100 Free Books in Science Fiction. Sorry to say, but this book looks like the product of a sick mind.  I won't be reading it.",0

1832,2,"I WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER WHO DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK.  Great love scenes, super sexy hero, yes.  I'll give you that.  Totally pathetic female who keeps pawing after him even after traumatizing humiliation years ago.  A family that treats her like crap, the male who just wants to run from her until his libido takes over, the male who hooked up with and had a long term relationship with her ""more beautiful"" evil sister, the male who called out the sister's name during sex! (granted, it was in negativity, not ecstasy), but still... the female who gave up her virginity on the dirty ground behind his truck... he never had to own up to ANYTHING he did... yes, people ""make mistakes"" when they are young, but they are ACCOUNTABLE for them!!  God, he never had to really own up to anything he said or did, past or present.  She simply chased him, finally landed him, and then that was supposed to be the beautiful ending?..... no thank you.... she should have made him really see what he lost... she totally caved and although the author tried to write her as a ""strong"" female... her actions were pathetic... sure, you could say she was determined in her shameless pursuit of him... but she pitifully let him get away with everything he'd ever done.... aarrgh!!!  Just doesn't set right with me.... I'm so bummed... because this author can write some sexy love scenes and I will still probably be curiously drawn to other books by her....",0
1833,1,"Hmmm??I have so many questions about this book. I couldn't get through the first 50 pages without putting it down a few times and asking myself ""What in the world is going on?""To be honest, Im not sure what was happening, where they were, and what was going to happen next.I'm not to sure even who the main characters were. It skipped around to much and left me feeling blank. The dialogue of the characters was absent. I couldn't connect with them.I thought it would be an sexy, exotic short.. but maybe it was a little to far fetched for my tastes...P.S.Whether the mystery is there or not, the setting was a ""sexy"" setting so that is why I used that words. A mystery is a mystery, its the characters and the setting that makes a difference. That's where exotic came from b/c of where you placed them..I didn't feel any connection with the characters and that is the first thing that I looked for. The characters were boring, nothing exciting, no drama between them.. (Im the type of reader that needs to be surprised or something in the beginning or its boring)I felt like the beginning was missing something. The whole burial of the dead body was quick, nothing to it, no background, no story, you even mentioned something about 40 hours ago but no explanation... Just ""they buried a body"" then skip to today... It's no suprise that a body was being buried, we were told that on the synopisis of the book.I choose to read it because i thought it would be exotic being that the idea ""vacationers at a sex retreat killing someone"" That's something that I never read before and I really wanted to know why....",0
1834,2,"I was eager to read this novel and downloaded it at the time it was 0.99. Big spender I know but I am glad I did not spend more. I was intrigued by the concept and some of the scenes of college life are both surreal and funny. Though that is all the positives I have for this meandering book. I mean there is no Jekyll Hide scenario, no ON/OFF if you will, Its like the whole book is more off than on, there is one speed and it is slow. Jamie Pepper undergoes an experiment to battle a disease of the brain. At first it seems effective, but is it really? Are these strange dreams he is having or is he doing things he is unaware of? None of it seems believable enough to me to warrant the climax. I will say that the life in the dorm aspect is entertaining and funny, but the novel as a whole was a big disappointment to me.",0
1835,2,"I was excited at first. The first starts with a girl named Robyn who is strong and outdoorsy who also happens to be deaf. She is arguing with her brother letting him know that she can go on a trip all by herself. I already liked her. Then, the story takes a shift in to fast, skippy, and lacking luster. The plot goes sour when she runs into two wolves who tell her she's one. She willingy accepts it, accepts that she's the mate of one, and then they have lots of sex where she goes places she's never been willingly. This once fiesty, independent girl became a willing dependent in a matter of a page turn. It was written ok, but the plot went out the window once she got to the cabin. Beyond that, it goes boring and then ends with a girl who on her first night is going to have sex in wolf form in front of the whole pack with her new mate she's known all of a week. I'd say that the girl lost her mind in the woods mostly. Hopefully the writer will get more inventive and risk lengthening the story in order to give more depth to the plot.",0
1836,2,"I read a book, look through it twice, looking for pages I missed... Kind of a story that make you think you bought a shortened version of a book, or pages are missing...",0
1837,2,"I enjoyed the atmospheric opening and the descriptions of the locales, but the story took about three times to tell as necessary. This wasn't helped by the fact that the heroine's decisions become increasingly difficult to comprehend and so much of the explanation of why she never does the obvious and logical thing each time she has a choice comes so late in the book that it's likely almost impossible for the reader to identify with her reasoning. She seems by far a weaker rather than a stronger character because of this. The final resolution seems equally incomprehensible; a good literary surprise comes as the inevitable twist that you should have seen coming, but this was simply out of left field.Some of the heroine's self-realizations are intriguing and well-written, but rather in the same way that the author repeats the same scenario over and over, she repeats these moments of self-awareness again and again.Two stars for the descriptions and atmosphere.",0
1838,2,It was a good read but I don't like short stories. I wanted more with this story and was very disappointed that it ended as quickly as it began.,0
1839,1,"THIS IS A WARNING TO ANYONE THINKING ABOUT READING THIS SERIES. THIS SERIES CONTAINS REFERENCE TO, AND IN THE FINAL BOOK, AN ENTIRE STORY REVOLVING AROUND INCEST.This first book in the series is just basically an introduction to the series, and contained no reference to incest, but the second book did. I bought the other three books in the series based solely on this book, because I liked Sonny and Garron and wanted to find out how their story progressed. References to the incestuous relationship between Sonny's identical twin brothers starts in the second book, and through character thoughts and conversations, the author makes it clear that the relationship is long-term (going back to childhood), consensual, and accepted without a murmur by the rest of the family and apparently the entire town. I found this beyond disturbing, and promptly returned the entire series for a refund.After returning them, I went back and read the book descriptions more thoroughly, but beyond a vaguely worded comment in the description of the fourth book, none of them carry any kind of warning that these books contain sensitive or disturbing material. I did find references when I read all the reviews of the fourth book, but it should not be up to the readers to warn others about things like this. That should be responsibility of the publishers and Amazon. That even the fourth book, which deals directly with the incestuous relationship, carried no warning whatsoever is completely unacceptable.So I'm putting this warning on the first book in the series, before people get involved with the characters and their stories. I will also be reading the descriptions and every single review for any books I consider purchasing from this author in the future.",0

1841,2,"With Beg Me, I just don't know what to say. I am really disappointed with this story. I happen to love stories with rough sex, forced sex, or rape roleplay. So I knew this part of the story wouldn't bother me at all.The heroine does like it raunchy with some dirty talk like 'hot bi***' and 'dirty slut.' I love this. I also love the bondage and domination both characters are into. Even the heroine's recent traumatic past didn't upset me, at least not in a bad way. I was prepared to feel sympathetic toward her. So why didn't I like this book then?Despite having all the above elements going for it, this story was just flat to me, very one dimensional. It's a pale imitation of every good/great story with the same themes. Yes, some parts of it were sexy, but the story was so deficient in other areas.I didn't dislike the heroine but I also wasn't that into her at first. Then she became unlikeable to me. The way she treated the hero, by making him do something he really felt sick at heart about; that just really ticked me off. So given what she's been through, this justifies her right to tear him up inside in order to make herself feel better? Sure, she wants to take back her sex life, but the disregard she showed him annoyed me. The man would do anything for her, and she asks him to do the unbearable. The guy's practically sick to his stomach, but it's ok as long as it makes her feel better? The h comes across as weak and selfish.Other parts of the story were just as annoying: the overdrawn mother-in-law character, the h's absolutely ineffective confrontation with MIL, the H's watered-down manhood (I mean, the h virtually turned him into a punching bag for someone else's transgressions), the poor editing, and the overall unsatisfactory storytelling.The hero was the only slightly bright spot of the story and even he couldn't save it from itself. He had his moments but not enough to offset the actions of the heroine.To me, this is just not a good read, not even an okay read.If you want to try a good story with some of the same elements but with some really thought-out characters, maybe sample these -Willing Victim(rough sex, rape fantasy, domination)Helene Blackmailed(rough sex, forced sex/coercion, domination)On the Edge(rough sex, domination, menage)Demon's Captive(rough sex, forced sex/coercion, domination)",0
1842,1,"I thought this book confusing, written badly, worded badly. I spent a lot of time rethinking the words.This lady, I can only assume is British, or an Anglophile, her mixed metaphors are horrendous! Do people still shout Blimey?  This seemed to be placed in the 40's, but it was not, time also a family being part of a town for 1900 years in the US, is a long time, however for this author it was a drop in the bucket.  The worst part is the repetitive claptrap, if you edited out how many times she would say someone was this or that witches do do not do that? The book would have been 30% shorter.  I also did not like the convoluted Witchcraft in her world,and the astounding superiority they felt.  While there are more books in this series? I will not be reading them.  Oh, for the author, one chews or bites their lips, but we gnash our teeth.",0
1843,2,It was alright. Nothing to rave about. It wasn't a bad book however it wasn't memorable. I feel the story was rushed and the characters were not well developed.  It had potential but...This is my opinion of the book so hopefully the author can understand that this time. We are all entitled to an opinion whether it's good or bad,0

1845,2,"I'll admit, I got this e-book because it was free, and because I'm on a bit of a post-apocalyptic bender.  That said, I won't be getting the sequels to this title.The scenario the author comes up with to kick things off is as plausible as anything else in this type of fiction.  No, the biggest problem I had with this story was the way people talked.  Everyone sounded incredibly stilted and formal.  People use contractions in every day language, but that isn't very evident in this story.  Perhaps linguistic conventions have changed by 2068?Even if that was so, there's no way to justify the overuse of italics in the text. Italics is fine for displaying character thoughts, the names of vessels, movies, books and songs.  A writer can even use it to denote particular emphasis in the spoken dialogue.  But why on earth would you italicize landmarks? The names of buildings and bridges?  I'm not a Grammar Nazi, but I found it irritating and distracting.Overall, I think this wasn't a bad effort, but I personally feel that the author could have benefited from the participation of an editor or an impartial beta-reader.",0

1847,1,"I understand about marketing techniques but really, sometimes, one gets too far.The first 10 % of the content are praises for the legal thriller Beyond Justice, the last 49 % of the content is an excerpt from Beyond Justice.The very short rest is a story with such a naive, simple christian content as to make it unbearable for the adult reader. I'm also offended by the tittle since for me, the power of God is anything BUT accidental.I do believe in the power of God or the possibility of redemption but seriously ? From killer to saint in the space of one heartbeat ? And it's not like this story has never been told before, better, with more character development, more depth and in a way that takes the reader on the journey and makes him feel closer to God. This ACCIDENTAL HERO, well..just did not do it at all.",0

To say that the interaction was stiff, superficial and one dimensional would be like saying that the ocean is a bit wet. Its also salty and contains a vast aray of life and wonders yet to be explored. Which pretty much sums up my feeling of this book.

While I might not be completely into the cowboy trope like the other readers I have enjoyed it on occasion (so it's not that), but this one just felt like a cliched, by-the-numbers plot. It lacked any kind of interesting qualities and missed the sexual chemistry between Micah and Tucker by a mile. I like her other books immensely, but this will be quickly forgotten for her other entertaining books.",0

1855,1,"I thought this was just a horrible book.  The writing seemed to be the result of some creative writing class assignment, the dialogue was trite and cliched.  Just as an example, the death of two people who are discovered in a crash train car are proclaimed as ""not accidental"" by the police - what gave it away, the multiple stab wounds or the fact that the bodies were already in rigor and the train car just crashed.  A monopoly on world food supplies by controlling the seeds - anyone ever hear of Burpees.The whole opening scene consists of our ""hero"" chasing after a runaway train car (to do what we have no idea since it's a 70 ton runaway) and causes several traffic accidents that kill innocent people and we're somehow supposed to overlook that because he had a higher purpose in somehow warning the town of the runaway car.  It made absolutely no sense to me and even the crash scene is so exaggerated as to be unbelievable (do you really think a fully loaded boxcar is going to slide that far on it's ride after coming off the rails - come on).The story line was weak, the characters shallow and not particularly likeable and the protagonist can seemingly kill at will without getting caught.  This is the one of the few times I bought a Kindle version of a book without downloading a sample first because of all the positive reviews.  Wish I'd saved the $3.00 as the sample would have taken me far enough into the book to realize this just isn't a good book.My apologies to all those that read and absolutely raved about this book.  There are so many well written, exciting and suspenseful books in the Kindle library that something as trite as this just doesn't deserve to be read.  I'm obviously in the minority here but do follow my suggestion and sample the book before buying.",0
1856,1,"Wow!  What a total waste of my money and time.  I assume this was self-published?  Does the author not have a few friends capable of proofreading the book for her?  I didn't get past the first 5 or 6 pages on my kindle.  Multiple unintelligible sentences in a row was too much for me.

Between how boring this installment was and how gullible Josie continued to be throughout it took me nearly 3 weeks to force myself to read the darn thing. I'm sorry to be so harsh but I like to get sucked into a book, see everything through the characters eyes. And all I could think about in this one was, 'When will something exciting happen?'Unfortunately I am not the type to give up on a series, I need to see it through and since the third installment has such high reviews I'll probably look into it. However I would still recommend that you not waste your money.Sorry Rachel, just didn't care for it.",0

And they lived happily ever after. All at about an eighth grade reading level.That's the book. No need to waste your money on it, really. It's a formula that's been done so many times there is no hope of squeezing any originality from it at all. The story was boring and predictable and the sex was pedestrian. This isn't even taking into account the exorbitant price that the publisher is charging for such a short novella of such little imaginative value.Nothing to see here.

1860,2,"I enjoy reading several different types of erotica, but this story had an attitude that I did not like, and would not recommend it to others.",0
1861,2,"The book started off okay, but I quickly lost interest in the characters. The writing just meandered along with aimless direction, and when I would put the book down and come back to it later I often forgot who was involved/connected to whom. The ""friendship"" that connects the main characters is very underexplored, and it's more a fairly boring snapshot of three lives wandering in and out of each other's. I wouldn't waste your time.",0
1862,2,It Is Just My Opinion But I Did Not Like This Book At All. I Pretty Much Rushed Through It And I Have Not Read It Since. I Don't Even Want To Continue The Series...,0
1863,2,"I received a complimentary copy of this short story for writing a review.  In a few short chapters we learn that Ainsley Walker's husband has left her after he completed law school.  She has battled depression and spent a week in a psychiatric hospital.  Then she loses her job.  Not much else can happen.  Then on a whim to sell a ring she is given an opportunity to do something new and exciting.  Of course we don't know what, because the story abruptly ends here.I didn't realize that this was a short story and was really upset when I reached the end with no resolution to anything.  I wouldn't buy because I wouldn't want to see a similar ending.",0

1866,2,"Couldn't quite get going with this story, for some reason it wasn't a fit with me. Perhaps because it started with all the culture of werewolves in Malta instead of easing into it.Having been to Malta and waiting for more of it, I was bit disappointed hence couldn't get into it. But this was a free read on amazon so it was a nice try even though it wasn't for me.",0
1867,2,"Plain and simple:  THE IDEA WAS GOOD. THE EXECUTION BAD.**Some Spoilers**Let's cut to the chase, shall we?  I can't believe I paid for this book.It needs editing SO bad.  The flow is off, there are missing words, things really should be re-worded, and the structure is pretty wrecked.  Not to mention punctuation, grammar, etc.It was pretty juvenile.  Girl has boyfriend (a nice one at that), breaks up with boyfriend because SHE thinks SHE is not good enough.  Suddenly she meets her guardian (he saves her from an accident), and talks to her guardian about twice. Suddenly, she is in love and obsessed.  I didn't even get to see a relationship develop at all!  There was no developing. I do not even understand their relationship.  Hell, I liked Carter more because he was more 3-D than the 2-D relationship with Seth...The only reason It got a 2 from me is because there were some parts I liked and I liked Gen for most of the time.  She seemed real - except for the whole 'insta'-love thing with Seth.Don't get me wrong, I'm usually pretty generous with book reviews.  I don't actually like giving bad reviews.",0
1868,2,"I couldn't get into this story. As much as I enjoyed the idea, some of your descriptions made me gag...in disgust. Plus, I know it's a short, but I feel like if it was expanded a bit more, the romance between the main character and Ryan wouldn't seem so unbelievable.",0

1871,1,"AAAGGGHHH. I'm giving up after the first few pages. This book is impossible to get through - sounds like it was written by a high school student who hasn't quite learned basic sentence structure and proper use of tense, but imagines he himself to be literate.  In addition to incorrect tense, puncutation, grammar and verb form, the vocabulary and basic writing is juvenile.A few examples:""He looked across at the other three mean, making sure they were ready, they all looked at him in readiness.""""...but also any human who took the law into THEIR own hands""""Thousands of people go missing every year, many are never found, the Church always suspected that many were turned, but could not prove it or perhaps didn't want to.""Don't have time for more examples - have to run and DELETE this from my Kindle.

1872,2,"2.5 stars. A quick read that left me mostly cold. Reads like it was written by a teenager... repetitive themes (ghosts and babies galore, and &#34;breather&#34;? really?) , weak &#34;twists&#34;, and no thrills at all. If I had paid any more than 99 cents for this book, I would have been seriously annoyed.",0
1873,1,"This piece is well written in a dark, perverse, way.  I just am puzzled about what the message is here. To depict children as mean spirited monsters is to negate the innocence of childhood.  I did not like this at all!!!",0
1874,1,"This series was so boring. I got halfway through the book and I could care less who made it out alive and who didn't. It was juvenile, somewhat stilted and sometimes downright comical. People showed up with no explanation, didn't know who they were or where they came from. Characters seemed like they had the substance of a paper doll. All in all...even for .99 cents, it was a waste of a morning for me.",0
1875,1,"This story was just ridiculous.  Rajah and Larkspur are completely out-of-place in this story - they speak like modern people (Larkspur likes to call a certain part of Rajah's body ""yummy"" frequently) and they're both supposed to be virgins but exhibit an amazing grasp of the mechanics and techniques of sex.  It keeps the reader from getting involved in the story at all - it's like reading an erotic story set in modern times that has somehow been gene-spliced with a story about a dragon and his human mate - and neither story benefits from the incongruity.Lark is also an annoying character.  She and her father were split up by pirates, she has no idea where he is, and she is kidnapped by a dragon.  She resists for about two minutes before deciding to spend the rest of her life with him.  I couldn't have much respect for somebody who didn't even care to find out how her father was or letting him know that she was okay.  And she's so demanding . . . ""do me this way,"" ""do me that way,"" ""do me this way.""  Rajah was talking about spending the next three hundred years with her . . . I give him a week and a half before he drops her back into the ocean, completely fed-up with her.",0
1876,2,"Suggestions to the author:First suggestion: Class this as a children's book as it would be perfect for a group of 8-to-10-year-olds around a Cub Scout campfire.Second suggestion: Get an editor to PROOFREAD and edit your book!!!  My God, is the woman in your story a radio astronomer or a radio astrologer???  Only you and your hairdresser know for sure.  In addition, part of the reason your book rates only two stars is because it is swimming in errors which are too plentiful to overlook.Third suggestion: Get an editor...'NUFF SAID.Fourth suggestion: Don""t make the U.S. Military the villain when you are writing about a 2000 year old Mayan myth; after all, regardless of how much you apparently dislike our Military...it's a shame you feel the need to demonize them and use them as a scapegoat (no ""goat"" joke intended) for something as unimportant as this book.Suggestion to potential readers:Don't!

1877,2,"Delia has a very distant relationship with her father, but that doesn't mean she isn't devastated when her childhood home, Steward House burns in a fire. Her father is left in a coma as a result. Not having much money, and knowing she will have substantial medical bills in the near future for her father, she decides to sell Steward House to Grant Wolverton. She has had a crush on Grant since childhood, but he doesn't remember her. Very wealthy, Grant who deals in antiques and art, offers to restore Steward House, and Delia reluctantly hands over the deed for a great sum of money.Delia herself is a stone conservator - but that is not where her special abilities end. She can also communicate with the stone statues. They keep her company but they have also made her the town outcast. Stories have been swirling about her odd behavior in the small town she is from. Now that she is back in that small town, gossip starts again. Afraid to let Steward House go completely, she offers to take over the remodel. Grant agrees - and neither can quite let go of the attraction that is building between them. But the question of who set the fire is still unsolved and there is another woman in town who has her eyes set on Steward House and Grant.Stone Kissed is an odd little book. I say that because it is different - and I really wanted to like it. But I had some problems. It starts off rough and the first third of the book I had a really hard time with. The sentences and changes from scene to scene were jerky and not smooth. I didn't understand Grant and had a hard time with the intense attraction Delia feels for him. About halfway through things start to settle down and I became more immersed in the story. It is a dark book. Delia has an awful relationship with her father who is now comatose so she has guilt in that area. She had to give up her home which she feels a great connection to, and she has to figure out these intense feelings for Grant. I had a hard time buying into the romance. The actual sex scenes are very sensual, but I didn't get Grant's love for Delia. Delia herself has had a crush on Grant for years, so her side makes more sense. But for most of the book, Grant thinks Delia is delusional for her claim to talk to statues and he thinks she is a thief for taking his statues from him. Yet he still falls in love? I buy into the fact he lusted after her and likes her in his bed, but not love.I liked the statue aspect and how they interacted with Delia. I also think the villain in this story is well done - nothing is held back in terms of the evil emanating from her. But the overall tone of the book is so dark and depressing. I tend to like darker books, but there wasn't anything to grasp onto as we waded through the serious stuff. I never quite understood Delia and Grant. And when I don't believe in the love between the hero and heroine, I can't be satisfied by the story.",0
1878,2,"... Well maybe not let down as much as disillusioned. I have read about open relationships in other books and have not had a big problem with it...not really my flavour but if it is set up right then it's fine. I think what threw me is it the book opens with Angelo and Cole having sex with Zach going, sure whatever you want. Now, I had just read their book, Angelo and Zach's and there was nothing in that book that sets up the relationship as moving in that direction... If anything it is the opposite. So, overall while I think the book was technically well done I am just feeling disappointed in their relationship now. I think that if the author had prepared the way in the first book it wound not have been so bad ,,but that didn't happen. so this whole open relationship, one sided by the way (Angelo only), just ended them in a sour note for me.",0
1879,2,"So a tale whose title begins with the ""R"" word is not generally on my ""to read"" list.  However, I do love a tale that revisits familiar characters in a new way, (Bridget Jones, Pride & Predjudice & Zombies, The Chosen . . .).Alas, this one did not live up to my expectations.  It was pretty shallow & silly really, and did not provide much to hold my interest.Oh well, you win some, you lose some.",0
1880,1,"I like snark, and especially lady snark. Something I greatly dislike though, is an author stating over and over and over again (see what I did there? annoying, right?) how she has been married for EIGHTEEN years and that's why she's an authority on xyz after EIGHTEEN years of marriage. A good editor would have pointed out the repetitiousness of this, but since that didn't occur, thanks to the miracle of the Kindle, a reader can conduct a specific word search  and find out how many times EIGHTEEN is repeated . This short little book used it TWENTY times. It would've actually been much funnier if it had been EIGHTEEN times. I stopped reading at SEVENTEEN percent. EIGHTEEN percent was just too much for this reader.",0
1881,2,"This is a very slow paced novel.  I was willing to stick with it, but it was too slow for me.  Indulging the author's intent to build the drama is one thing.  Continually having the heroine ignore missing pieces of information becomes unrealistic and entirely unbelievable.  *Not a complete novel.*  I would have considered paying for the final three chapters but decided I didn't care enough about the characters to follow up.",0
1882,2,"Unfortunately did not like this book at all.  I found the plot to be dumb, and the writing was sub-par.  The ending was better than the first 3/4 of the book, but not worth the money paid.  Sorry Rhyannon!  Normally I love your books, but this one should have been scrapped.",0
1883,2,"This book was stupid.  The two main characters knew each other in high school.  Fifteen years later, they meet again when he is a gynecologist in her doctor's office.  Even though they were supposedly crazy about each other way back then, he doesn't even recognize her.  She devises a plan to have her revenge on him because of a supposed bet he had with his friends back in high school regarding her big boobs.  When he finally realizes who she is, he devises his own plan for revenge.  Both of their plans were stupid.  I never really understood the bet he supposedly had.  Also, for someone who always hated her big breasts, she sure did seem to throw them out there a lot.  I really got tired of hearing about her big boobs.  The ending just seems to happen with no climax.  This book was just stupid.",0
1884,2,"The book is an ok read.  The ending is lame -as mentioned before - it caters to today's secular world, and doesn't reflect our Catholic teaching.",0
1885,2,"I was disappointed in this story, it was too short and lacked the substance that I have experienced in other works by this author. Still waiting for Ms. Black to make her comeback in Erotic romance, I know what she is capable of and this just did not measure up.",0
1886,1,"First I have to admit I did not finish this book. The writing was terrible and all over the place. I had a hard time trying to figure out what the heck was going on with this book. It was really weird. It took so long before the H and h even met and when they did it just seemed so forced. I had read the customer reviews before I purchased it, more had good things to say versus bad. So I figured I would give it a whirl. Big mistake. Lost .99 cents and a few hours of my life I will never get back. Skip it!!",0
1887,2,I really wanted to like this story but I couldn't. It was an okay book but definitely not worth re-reading. It took forever for the plot to hit its stride and then when it did it kinda fizzled away. Don't waste your money on it. Move on to another author.,0
1888,1,"This was such a spin on Criminal Minds as far as characters are concerned, bit of X-FILES, a bit of another TV show that was about abnormal people where the craziness was contagious.",0
1889,2,"I can see I am in the minority here - but I found the romance in this book completely unbelievable. The heroine lays eyes on the hero and all of a sudden she's madly in love... and we are given no real reason. Sure, he's a hottie, but he's not that nice to her (which doesn't stop her hormones from raging.) None of this provides a foundation for love and I found the ""instant soulmate"" thing to be trite.Two stars for the interesting time travel concept - very different!",0

1891,2,"The Governess was chosen for her youth and ability to look after the two children, Miles and Flora, joining the cook as another member of the household. The uncle of the children had instructed her not to contact him, to make all the decisions regarding the children herself, that he didn't want to hear from her at all. She was excited to have the position, and delighted in the children, also finding a friend in the cook.But all was not as it seemed, with two past employees appearing to be watching them on odd occasions. The Governess and the cook were struggling with what was happening...the children, beautiful angels they seemed, but maybe they weren't so angelic? Or was it the sanity of the Governess that was the problem?I struggled with this book. It was difficult to read, with long sentences which didn't make a lot of sense at times. For me, the sense of horror wasn't there, the passages seemed stilted and didn't draw me in. I had no connection to the characters either. I know it was written a long time ago, but it was definitely not for me I'm afraid!",0
1892,2,"I was not impressed! The plot was too predictable and the characters shallow. The writing was a bit stilted, as well. I would not go on to Book 2.",0
1893,1,"I enjoyed the series' first book but put off getting this one as the title made it sound like yet another cooking/recipes read. It isn't a cookbook, but it is as slow as cold syrup. Errors wreak havoc. The police chief is a slow-witted investigator.  I actually went back and checked details, thinking I had missed a  book between &#34;Snow&#34; and this one. At  a minimum, a lot of editing is needed, and the word swain need never again be used anywhere. It is a shame; the story idea is good, execution poor. Such problems are what you get with self-pubishing.",0
1894,2,I liked the story but I thought it was a little long. I think it could have been shortened up a little.,0
1895,1,"I don't know what others read (those who gave it a high rating) but I definitely didn't read that book. My book was confusing. It's like you have to start with book one. So my suggestion is that it only be sold as a group because you can't pick up one and follow the story. I don't like to read a book and it's like I just joined a conversation and I don't know what the heck we're talking about or why.Now this is just my opinion but I DID NOT LIKE THIS BOOK. It took me forever and three more years to finish. Therefore it gets a no, no, and heck fire NO rating.By the way, I've read other books by this author and I've enjoyed them. But I definitely did not enjoy ""A Lover's Worth - Ramsey V"".",0
1896,2,The best thing I can say about this book is that it wasted very little of my time. This author has done better. She would do well to skip the trash talk and the over done sex scenes and focus on the character development and dialogue. The good thing is she does get better than this effort shows.,0
1897,2,"I don't normally like to give away the plot of a book but if this short story was re titled ""My blue haired alien girlfriend came for a visit and was taken away"" this would tell you all you needed to know and save the time reading it.",0

1899,1,"There was nothing wrong with the writing and I had high hopes of a good story coming my way.  Maybe if I'd stuck with it a while longer it would have gotten better... but I was almost half way thru and it was just so confusing and convoluted I couldn't make sense of it.  It's a shame because taken in small segments the scenes were interesting to read and I got a feel for Bubba... but it was just too over-the-top in so many little areas.  One minute he seemed pretty smart, the next he seemed pretty stupid... lots of characters...flowing in and out... couldn't tie the story and the characters together.  Needed a cheat sheet to keep up with who was who...and what was what.  Blah... I just shut it up and deleted it off my Kindle.",0
1900,2,"After reading the other readers reviews I think I might have a different impression of the book had I read the prequel to this story.  However, as it stands, I am left wondering where the HEA in this story is.  I must admit that threesome stories are not my cup of tea because I always feel someone is getting the short end of the stick and it is usually the h.  In this one the h definitely got left with a toothpick size stick.  (SPOILER)  She is left with a husband that IMO is not all that spectacular.  The guy hands her out without talking to her first or taking her into consideration at all.  He seems completely self-absorbed during the entire book and then doesn't even defend her when she is called a b***h.  This author is a real hit and miss for me and this one was a miss.  I wish that the h would have left her husband and find someone to cherish her.  Isn't that what romance is about?  Geesh!  If you want to read a threesome book where all the characters were on a more leveled out playing field I would recommend Laid Bare (Lauren Dane).",0

She has sex with her fish creature shifting body guard. Ok.",0
1903,2,This book was another mystery of who done it?  Were the good guy gets blamed for the murder and has to clear his own name with the cops.  While fining out someone who he thought was a friend is really not that great of a friend.  the ending ends as predicted.  I read this on my kindle and I know it's not a big deal but there were quite a lot of grammer errors that did start to irritate me.  Overall it was a nice book.,0
1904,1,Slightly creeped me out this one.  No Olivia Cunning in the making.  More disturbing for how dopey the heroine was and how psychotic the hero was and let's not even mention the surprise appearance of a heavenly body at the end.  Well surprised me anyway!,0

It does this so much I got bored with it. The writing and story is good...it just takes so long to push through it. Never had this problem before. Like the story line and want to know what happens...but not interested in purchasing his other books.Was not connected to the characters either. Wanted to have compassion and understanding for Two and Theroen...just couldn't get there. It was hard to take Two seriously...maybe it was her name. Didn't see the point.",0

No real food for thought here.",0

The writing needs more than just a little polish as it's full of silly phrases, grammatical errors, inconsistencies and filler.",0

This was a book where every chapter was in itself a different story with no end and no meaning.

Bottom line this was so boring.",0

Unfortunately, the author stopped dead in the narrative to give every character's back story! While this information MIGHT have been necessary, it should have been worked in much later in the book.

Megan a waitress in a Hooters type restaurant meets Mike when he agrees to help chaperone a group of teenage boys at Megan's restaurant. He takes one look at Megan and is captivated by her beauty. Mike feels an uncontrollable urge to have sex with Megan. He jumps her bones immediately in spite of her feeble protest.I love Alpha males that show compassion, respect and empathy toward the women of their affection as they fall in love. He can be bossy and demanding but I must feel that he has the best interest of the woman he wants in mind as he pursues her.  Not a guy just looking for his next hook-up. Unfortunately Mike came across as a sexual predator and Megan was his willing victim. All she could think about was trucks and boots after having sex with a guy she admits she doesn't know. And then she closes her eyes and pray she made the right decision to let him take her to his home afterwards..... mhm.  I have read and enjoyed all of Lynda Chance's novellas except for TITMAM, the warmth and love you usually find in a LC short story was missing.Ms Chance is a new author for me, she has a unique style of witting the modern Alpha male that I love.

1919,1,Have never read this book neither have I bought this. I do not know why I have been ask to review it.,0
1920,2,"Okay, I got this one for free, so no money lost for me. And I'm glad, for this was unfortunately a disappointing story.It starts out very good thought, you get right into the action, and meet all the main characters very fast. Larissya is destined to be the Crystal Warrior, and is supposed to save the world. The Triad is the Evil ones, and the race is on to find all the hidden crystals before ""the other team"".There is several remarks thorough the story about ""the propecy"", but you never get to read it.. Exept for a few sentences at the very end. Thats irritating.The characters never develop -at all! They are very one-dimensional. Exept for the evil ones, no one ever gets angry. Sometimes someone gets scared, but thats it. There's no real feelings, no good descriptions of the characters quality, motivation, thoughts, or background. Just some shallow hints about Larissya, but even here, there is little to learn. Theres a mild love-story and some hint here and there, but again - it lacks motivation and reasons why.Same goes for places, cities etc.The story itself is not original, but then again - few fantasy-stories are.What is original is the animals in this world! But sadly, they are mostly accessoiries or background-noise.I would have loved to see them described even better, and to know more about them.There's a lot of action, but this is an ""all-the-good-guys-survives""-tale, almost till the end.What this book lacks is the feeling of reality, of being submerged in the story, and living it with the people you read about. It's simply not real - at all! The writing style feels very young, and immature. English is my second language, and even I caught a lot of spelling errors! The author has a lot of potential, but needs more training, and an good editor.An entertaining read, with lots of action. But, the warrior mostly loses her weapons and blacks out, the bad guys are just bad - not motivated by something, and there is way to little explanation, background and reasons for everything that happens.When I finished the book, I actually got a bit angry, because there wasn't an good ending. No reason why, or how. It feels...pointless... to have read for so many hours, and ending up with a feeling of nothing beeing resolved. And why does a ****ship suddenly appear? Too many things feel out of context, and ""threwn in there"".As aforementioned - the author has potential, but really need more training in making thing feel real!Well, I honestly can't recommend this. But if you like a lot of action, and don't care about good in-depth characters, backgrounds or explanations - go ahead ;)",0
1921,1,It was an interesting idea that could have been summed up in a single sentence. Bodice ripper. Two femmes. Not my style.,0

1923,2,"I knew when I got this that it was flash fiction, so I wasn't expecting a novel or anything. However, I was expecting it to be written better. The end did not scare/shock me. In fact, without the author's note I would not have understood what the theme of the story even was. It was a good idea, just poorly executed. Describing everything at the beginning as dark, dark was annoying and sometimes plain stupid. The rest of it read very choppy and was just ultimately disappointing. Thank goodness it was free!",0
1924,1,"This was a boring book. There needed to be more of a back story to make it plausible or maybe give it a little meat.  Unfortunately, neither the sex nor the premise worked.

1925,1,"Because this book talks about archery as a part of the Zen experience, Amazon's search engine keeps giving it as a legitimate return, when searching archery information available in Kindle format.  While the book might have information as to how archery plays a part in the pursuit of Zen, people need to realize that there is virtually nothing within the book that will help an archer.  In short, Amazon really should remove the archery tag from the book that makes it appear in 'archery' searches.",0
1926,2,The descriptions were so vague that this barely counts as erotic.  It was a lot of set-up with very little payoff.  I was also really turned off by how mean-spirited the ending was.,0

I found myself skimming through many parts of the book just for the sake of finishing it.",0
1928,2,"""The Door at the Top of the Stairs"" was written by Alison Holt.  This appears to be a third book for Ms. Holt and a departure from her previous two detective mystery novels. The current novel is of the psychological thriller genre. The book is written in conversational dialog spoken by the characters. The writing is straight forward and does not offer any degree of complexity in structure which should be generally acceptable by a wide audience.The story is about a young female police officer, ""Jesse Shaunessy"" twenty six years old, who was dismissed from the police force after five years of service. The police psychologist assessed Jesse to be too traumatized to continue to serve. Jesse was an undercover narcotics agent. She witnessed her partner ""Pete"" accept a bribe and sell her out to a narcotics dealer who subsequently tortured her in retaliation for shooting his brother.Jesse, looking for work, shows up at the horse farm run by 57 year old Morgan Davis and her 65 year old life partner Dr. Ryland Caldwell. Ryland is a retired psychologist who after observing the odd behavior (and physical scars) on Jesse, engages in her rehabilitation. The story of Jesse's abduction and torture is then revealed through a series of ""regressive sessions"" devised by Ryland as therapy.  While this is all going on, there is a secondary plot afoot being crafted by one Cody Maitland, a college dropout, hired by Morgan as a favor to her neighbor, Cody's father. Cody is featured as a plainly despicable young man bent on causing Jesse to get fired through his plotting of nefarious incidences that Jesse will be blamed for.At about the time that Jesse is recovered from her therapy, the story, in an unexpected twist of events, culminates in the conclusion of the drama and some additional revelations about Jesse and her ordeal.There were a number of things about this book that I did not care for. The character of Jesse and Morgan were a bit too overdone for my likes. While Jesse may have had some reason for her incorrigible behavior, Morgan's was not comprehensible in comparison. Further, I thought the male attributes applied to Morgan made her look foolish at times. The description of Richard as a ""brilliant"" narcissistic killer also seemed misplaced. There was nothing revealed about Richard that lead the reader to conclude that he was ""brilliant"".  Quite the contrary, he came across as decidedly evil, but not particularly bright as evidenced by a number of silly misjudgments.  The Character of Cody seemed equally misplaced. It was uncharacteristic for a young man like Cody to have harbored a hatred so thoroughly consuming as to result in his destruction. That's not to say it couldn't happen, just that there was no particular background given about Cody that explained his behavior and thus left the reader to his own conclusions. Finally, I did not find any appreciation of the life style portrayal of the female characters. While there is nothing inherently wrong (a non-religious view) with such a portrayal, I didn't find it necessary to advance the story. Certainly there have been many good books written with characters of alternate life styles, but these almost entirely are about the characters as persons and not about their life style per se. In this case, the depiction of all the females in the story as lesbian did not offer any necessary structure to the drama. If Morgan had been Martin, it wouldn't have mattered. Unfortunately for me, some of the intimate descriptions made me decidedly uncomfortable - as in the same realm as imagining 26 year old Anna Nicole Smith with 88 year old J. Howard Marshall II.....creepy.Overall I would recommend this novel only with reservations. I think there are underlying issues with it that would disenfranchise too many readers.",0
1929,2,"This is the first Star Wars novel I've read since the wonderfully adapted novelization of Revenge of the Sith by Matthew Stover. Sadly, Lost Tribe of the Sith: Precipice does not inspire me to continue reading expanded universe novels. While many readers find fault with the brief length of this novel, I found it to be the book's only saving grace (other than its price). Surprisingly, the characters in this novel are quite lackluster and are a far cry from the variety of Sith Lords we're accustomed to. Whereas the Sith Lords of the Star Wars films and previous EU books tend to be frightening figures, the 'humanized' Sith Lords in ""Precipice"" are poor ambassadors of the Dark Side of the Force.Perhaps this series will improve with successive books. But Precipice fails to deliver the kind of intriguing space opera that I love about Star Wars. Fortunately, Fate of the Jedi: Omen of which Precipice is only a prequel, appears to be a far more interesting read. As much as it pains me to say it, I would have a very difficult time recommending this book to anyone except the most die-hard Star Wars fan. Maybe John Jackson Miller will deliver the goods on the next go.",0

Perhaps making the effort to invest in the series would be rewarding, but not for me - I'll look for something less violent and more uplifting.I disagree with other reviewers who say it is well written. The author has tried far too hard to write what he thinks is good and produced large patches of purple prose. Consider just one short example -""Salient streaks meandered on his cheek and soaked his beard.""",0
1932,2,"I'm not quite sure whether or not I would recommend this book. If you're looking for something that's a quick read, then yes - this book may be for you. The idea of the story is that Tally has everything she could ever want, perfect friends, perfect boyfriend, etc... until one day she wakes up in the hospital and is told that everything she thought she had was actually a dream she was having while in a coma... The mystery continues when she's told that a drug overdoes caused the coma, even though she swears up and down she doesn't do drugs. Since her parents don't believe her it's up to Tally and her new-found friend to figure out who drugged her, and why.",0
1933,2,"Okay, so I read this story despite knowing that it was written by the author of ""Freeze"", a book I wasn't too fond of, and I am sorry to say I didn't like this one too much either. Here's why: First and foremost, like ""Freeze"", I found this story to be a bit juvenile, seemingly written for the preteen/teen crowd. Secondly, I dislike the author's fascination with the juvenile use of sex in this story; I mean really...two jerk (blank) sessions in one very short story accompanied by ongoing graphic references concerning semen and its various characteristics are a little much, don't you think??? There is the obligatory gore which seems to pervade this genre and, while some authors handle it well, this author overwrites his descriptive prose horribly. In addition, errors and omissions don't help garner higher ratings. Oh well, live and learn...perhaps the best tact for me is to simply stop giving this author other chances for redemption. I'll have to consider that. In the meantime...""SCRUBBING BUBBLES TO THE RESCUE""!",0
1934,2,"Trite story, poorly edited. Before you write anything about firearms most people would do some basic research.

It just stops and heads off in a different direction.In the end it leaves you thinking the author is more interested in publishing strings of words then in creating quality content.As with many free e-books, the last half of this short work is tidbits from other published works by the author. Most of the limericks are so bad that if I had a ""be sure to never buy anything from this author"" list I would take the time to add everything he ever wrote to the list.",0
1936,1,"I could not for the life of me bring myself to finish this book. Carlee was the stupiedest character I have ever read about.

I don't know how many times the man has to tell you He Just Doesn't Remember! so stop pushing him and Stop trying to make him feel something he just doesn't! It didn't work the first time It wont work now!I could have maybe understood her pushiness and as far as I'm concerned Stupidness if Trey was acting like a total jerk and dismissing her as a crazy person, but he wasn't. He felt the conection between them and just wanted to take things from there but Carlee just could not stop bringing up the past.I gave upI had to or I would have thrown my Kindle against the wall in utter frustration.I have no idea if Marilyn Lee managed to make Carlee a likeable person later on in the book but as far as I am concerned if she did it was to little to late.There are other Marilyn Lee books out there that are worth reading.

1938,2,I received a complimentary copy of this book in order to review it.  It was a super fast read and an OK story.  The main disappointment was the simplicity of the language.

Black vs White, Good vs Evil. Brother against brother and brothers standing together.The book is a fast read and the ending is as shocking as is the main points of scene development.  The world building is one that is build via the protagonists and it gives the story a more intimate and a more shock worthy approach.I loved the psychology that was explored behind conjoined twins.Unique read that is for sure.WaAr",0

1945,2,"I'm afraid this book didn't do it for me.The male pregnancy didn't really bother me and it's because the birth giving is not described in the book: the way it happens is explained, but the actual birth is skipped over. Now, I don't know if it's better this way because it would have been rather gruesome, I think, or if it shows a lack of courage on the part of the author.In my opinion this book lacks a bit of depth and I don't know if it would have benefited from some editing out or from a few more pages of character development. When the writer went into the feelings of the protagonists, I really liked the story and the last pages, where Neil had to go over a difficult moment (I don't want to spoil it for you), were really emotional, because I could relate to him and his suffering. The dragon seemed to me like a big puppy and not like the hot guy he should have been and by the end I was really tired of c*cks exploding.I had an issue with the use of the term of endearment ""piccola"" which is explained as the Italian equivalent of ""baby, babe"". It's ok if it's referred to a woman, but not so much if it is given to a man, in which case the correct word is ""piccolo"". It could have been written on purpose, but I'd rather see a man be treated like a man.",0

At the end you didn't even know if one of the main characters was good or evil.  Still confused.,0
1948,2,"In the introduction, the author thanks several people for their proofreading, support and advice. They did not give the help she thinks she received. This is a poorly proofed and edited book, and difficult to read. The author is not an American, was not raised in the US, and probably has never visited the US. Why she chose to place her story in the US is lost on me. I've read enough British literature to recognize the typical British phrases and vernacular used in this book. I was surprised when I finally realized that the author thought she was writing about Americans. I might have let the usage of British English spelling standards slip by, but it was more that that. Americans don't post a letter - they mail it. Hotel rooms have a bathroom, not an en suite. The descriptions of college life are not based on American college. So much of the vernacular is just off. This would have been a much better story if she had placed the characters in England maybe even in Canada, but not in California.The subject matter of the story line was not a problem, except I don't think there was much development in the characters. They change as they grow older, but they remain fairly shallow and undeveloped. There are a few tender moments, but for the most part there was just text that runs on.

1952,1,"Being married to a Brit I'm fairly used to the slang and what we American's call poor grammar, but this book took the cake. There were so many grammatical errors, misused words, misspelled words, and British slang being used by LA detectives, it took the readability right out of it. I might recommend this book to some of my 'illiterate' friends only because I know they'll never read it. It got 1 star because there is potential with the story-maybe a complete rewrite and relocate it to London. Police procedures-not even close. And when Patton finally takes on Caldwell, he fails miserably and his backup, while only mildly wounded, doesn't even get a shot off or see where the suspect disappears to? Also, going back to the beginning, if they found the first 2 victim's bodies, why weren't the forensics people able to figure out at that point what Sarah's clues meant? I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that I won't be reading any more by this author unless he learns to proof, edit, and research his material beforehand.

The first Zorn Warriors book was pretty good, and more in keeping with her usual tone. This second installment failed on so many levels for me. I couldn't develop any liking for the hero, mostly because throughout the book he continually took away the heroine's choices. While he repeatedly tells the heroine that she's his world and he'd do anything to keep her, he never once considers what SHE wants or how she feels about being kidnapped and forced into a lifestyle she didn't choose for herself.What's more, there's no &#34;a-ha&#34; moment when he realizes HIS happiness is not necessarily the key to HER being happy too. I kept waiting for him to redeem himself but it just never happened.And the heroine seemed weak to me because even though she didn't shy away from physical confrontation, she never really tells him &#34;NO.&#34; That subtext of &#34;her lips say no but her eyes say yes&#34; played here ad nauseum. Her protests were pretty weak and insincere, which makes her either totally spineless or the kind of woman who says one thing, means another and expects the guy to know what she wants without her really saying so.Don't get me wrong, I'll never give up reading Laurann.

I expect low cost/free books to have spelling errors, grammatical errors and just plain using the wrong words.  While jarring there was no more than normal for a first time unedited book.  As usual proofreading would have helped.  The story and plot lines are acceptably derivative.  Unfortunately the writer needs to find a good group of friends or a local writers group to help him learn how to smooth the pace out.  It reads as a series of shouted and disjointed distinct utterances instead of flowing smoothly.  Think of grade school when the teacher had everyone in class take turns reading a sentence out of a textbook.  Now compare that to a professional audio book.  The jerky, halting and stumbling narrative is just more than I can handle.  All this negative stuff being said, there are good bones here.  If the author took a ""How to write a book"" class at the local junior college and based it on this manuscript then the results would be about equal to standard journeyman mass produced series book.  It could be cleaned up to be the equivalent of a basic Star Wars, War Hammer 40k, or Battle Tech novel.  But in it's current form I just could not read the last 20-30 pages.  I quit in the very last couple of chapters.",0
1977,1,"This was an hour of my life that I will never get back.  Poorly written, lacking character structure, just not a good read.  It had the ability to be so much more but the characters and the plot were just never developed enough for me.",0
1978,2,"The romantic tension between the Lillian and Dominick/Trenton didn't come across as sincere and seemed more contrived as she didn't really have any meaningful interaction with either of them before making her decision.  Not a lot of plot to the story either.  I love to read good books over and over, but once was enough for this book.",0
1979,2,The story started out well and before you know it you are finished and looking for the next chapter.I went back to the beginning thinking I missed something.....but there was nothing there.I know this was a short story....but don't give me a story and then start another book. Left me confusedand wondering if the book downloaded incorrectly.,0
1980,2,"While this is an interesting and compelling crime novel, the ""American edition"" of this thriller was so frustrating to read (even at the $0.00 price), I gave up about 20% of the way through and paid for theoriginal UK version. This turned out to be $1.99 well spent in terms of orthodontic savings, as the US edition was causing me to grind my teeth.Sugar & Spice is a well-plotted and nicely paced thriller in the original UK setting; the geography, crime procedures and lexicon are seamless, organic elements of the book. In the US edition, the same elements are poorly executed and read as artificial, implausible, and jarring in their new versions. While the book has been physically relocated, it hasn't been linguistically relocated, and the result is deeply discordant. Some examples:When Thomas Bristow is driving to see his sister, he travels ""to take lunch"" with her, whereas Americans ""have lunch."" On this journey he notes the ""contra flow"" of traffic;contraflow is generally restricted to bike lanes in the US and the terms is not in wide US use. Bristow is pulled over by local law enforcement, and the officer asks him ""Do you have your documents with you, Mr Bristow?"" No US officer would ask for ""documents"" - the standard is ""licence and registration, please"" and it's a demand not a request. (In the US you  are required to drive with your license on you; in the UK you actually have 7 days to produce it after being pulled over.)All of the above examples take place within the span of three pages in the book, so you can imagine how dense with issues this version of Sugar & Spice is. As an American ex-pat who lived in London for 10 years before moving to Ireland, I may be more sensitive to these transgressions than the average reader, but I don't think so. They're irritating and distracting, and all the worse because this entire exercise is utterly unnecessary. Buy the UK version if you'd like to read Sugar & Spice.",0
1981,2,"I'm happy I have A Christmas Carol now, but they filled up the rest of the book with stories by unknown people (at least to me) that were BORING. Snoozers. This book is not worth it if you have to pay money for it.",0
1982,1,This story is very short and not that good. It's kind of strange to see the two mothers from one of Shakespeare's classics turned into secret lovers. The love scene is short and there isn't much detail in the rest of the story at all. The entire story can be read in less than 5 minutes. I've read a few other stories by Kitt and this book is definitely not her best work.,0
1983,2,"Sorry, but the word 'quicksand' was a great name for this book. I was ok with the first 50 pages or so but the word  quicksand came up way too often, at the drop of any problem the characters had to face along with the actual description of quicksand. That kind of irritated me but the mystery that came near the end of the book proves once again, Mrs. Adams is not a mystery writer. The whole mystery hinged on too many people's involvement and there were way too many little happenings that leaves one scratching her head to figure out where they fit. The whole  mystery situation was resolved in the last 4 pages of the book...to fast, too contrived. It was like, &#34;How the heck could anyone begin to get an idea of what was going to happen?&#34; Even the CHRISTIAN element didn't feel sincere. I think I just read my last Diane Adams book.",0
1984,1,"He had an english accent which he seemed trying to hide. I don't know this, but my impression is that europeons now own the WSJ.England s a great country, but I'm suspicious of europeon socialism. (I really can't spell it.) In particular the Brits are proud of their writing ability, and rightly so, but I'd rather have Americans brainwashing Americans, bad as that may be.",0
1985,1,Even with a special Kindle Single price I felt taken. I wasted time reading it. I'll be more careful next time.,0
1986,1,"I have tried off and on to read this book. I appears to have been writen by someone with a limited vocabulary, because it is shallow and full of foul words. I can not rate higher than 1/2 star.",0
1987,2,"I've read all the other ones in this series and really like them. This was just hard to read. I can't even get through the thing. I don't think it makes Peter as appealing as he is in the other books. I'd love to hear more about his story, but not if it's this boring. It's too bad because I was expecting something similiar to the other books. Still a fan, though.",0
1988,2,nothing special but nothing bad either. a harmless read when you have nothing to read and it was freeskip it,0
1989,1,"Ok...so heroine is raped and nearly murdered trying to save their father and a packmate...they think she is responsible, based on admittedly powerful evidence, but they don't think that maybe the girl that is raped and left for dead might not have had a role in it...they've known her her entire life...No. The heroes are the villains in this story. They only feel regret over they are proven entirely wrong, and only then seek to find her? I can't recommend this. It is one of the worst things I have ever read, and it came from Maya Banks? They left their dying, raped mate to die? No. You want this to be the conflict, you better offer some legitimate resolution, not some half-assed tail between the legs bs. I am furious after finishing this. If I hadn't read anything of hers prior to this, I would never read anything further by her. What went across her mind when she published this? Challenging the reader to have less than perfect heroes? They are the villains! They are almost as bad as the hunters that raped her in the first place. There was nothing romantic about this story. I don't know if I can any more emphatically urge you not to read it.",0
1990,2,"This was free in the Amazon Kindle store, which explains the two star rating.  I don't understand all of the non-verified Amazon purchased 5 star reviews as they must have read something different than what I started.This is a rambling ""something"" that is all over the place, and I had to stop after 17% through the Kindle version.  I have no idea what point the author was trying to make except something about death, and the frequent references along the lines of ""wait, I'll tell you about what is going to happen later"" became annoying fast.  After 10 minutes and 17% of the way through, I couldn't ""wait"" any longer.As I type this review, there are over 150 short stories available for free in the Amazon Kindle store.  I'd pass this one up and concentrate on the others.",0
1991,2,"I got this book because it was free. It takes about 10 mins to read and it's not really that bad. This middle age female has the hots for her neighbor who is stalking her but then she has sex with him without conversation and at the end they confess their undying love for each other although they have never had one face to face convo with each other. If you are in the mood for some quick erotica, it's not bad.",0
1992,2,"Got a Kindle and bought this just to experience purchasing an e-book from Amazon. Low quality Star Ship Troopers redux, Marines vs. Bugs. Don't waste your time. Just not very good writing. Read ""Outbound"" or ""Blood Orbit"" on your Kindle instead. These two will hold your interest. I've come to the realization that sf is just better in the short story format. Your money is much better spent on the ""Asimov,"" ""Analog"" or ""Fantasy and Science Fiction"" magazines offered on Kindle. Again, don't waste your money or time on this book. Blah.",0
1993,1,The only thing I liked about the book was the price. It was free. I've never written a negative review until now. Don't waste your time on this!,0
1994,2,This was a very interesting short novel about the lives of gods. It follows the royal court of Sumerian gods as they have internal conflicts. Overall the this novel had some strong ideas but it had problems in delivery.Stylistic problems like 'show-don't-tell' and rapid narrator switches made it hard to read. Also some portions of the story really confused me.It was very interesting and I would be interested to maybe try one more from the author. This one just wasn't stellar for me.***SPOILER ALERT*** Why would you send a known genocidal criminal to a planet full of your followers? Did you think the wolf god was going to cuddle the humans? ***SPOILER END***,0
1995,2,I have read other books by this author but this one was quite easy to figure out. I did not like it,0
1996,2,"I received a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for my review...With that said, I have to say I am relieved I didn't pay for it. Sci-fi is not my cup of tea, although since I began receiving books in exchange for reviews I have come across more than a few Sci-fi books that I actually enjoyed, and a couple I just couldn't put down, and actually purchased sequels to.This book was not well written in MY opinion. The main character just happens upon a camera bag, just happens to have a handy friend who has a card reader and jumps to the immediate conclusion that he has found a UFO. He also just happens to have a well placed family friend that just happens to agree to meet with him to look at the photos. This family friend just happens to have a gorgeous sister the same age as our main character who just happens to believe it's a UFO he's found also. Then they just happen to spot the person from the photographs waltzing around the area they are chatting in. Then they just happen to realize it's actually an alien in disguise and they happen to chase him through Washington DC without alerting the authorities from the get-go... Why how coincidental is that? A little too coincidental for me. Extremely cliched and not very believable on any level.I wouldn't recommend this book for anyone. I would have recommended it for a child, but there are some pretty grisly scenes in it that prevent me from doing so.={ Not so happy reading this time...",0
1997,1,"The premise of the story was an interesting one: a series of classmates being murdered several years after they graduated. Unfortunately, the overall plot and the price (free) are about the only good things I can say about this novel. Sorry, Mr. Moats!The book was riddled with run-on sentences and spelling errors, and the author's sentence structure was much too choppy for my taste. As a former English teacher, I can honestly say I've seen 8th grade essays that were much more beautifully written than this.And while the premise of the story is a good one, I just didn't think Mr. Moats did it any justice. Many, many points in the story were completely unbelievable. I realize that it must be difficult to write a mystery, but I found myself thinking many aspects of this story were just too convenient. There wasn't much thinking involved in this mystery; in fact, I think the only brain power I used while reading this novel was just to correct the grammatical errors!",0
1998,2,"The truth is that I have not noticed this was Harlequin romance at the time of downloading. I usualy do not read romance books but since it already was on my kindle I decided to give it a try during my vacation. Well - I did finished it since it was quite a quick read. I never realy grew to like the main characters though. The female character Lorna was weak and strange while the male character James was so perfect that he sounded out of this world unbelivable. Anyway, this was an interesting experience for me.",0
1999,1,"I would have easily given this book four stars or more. I really enjoyed the plot and the storyline however, most of the way through reading on my kindle on just about every page the last letter of every word is cut off making it a lot more difficult to read and make sense of.",0
2000,1,"I wanted to say something nice - the cover is pretty. Otherwise, not worth the time it took to download.",0
